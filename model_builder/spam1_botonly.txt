Oct 22 11:14:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <Acanadianrose> Hi! I'm looking at buying a PinePhone but wondering where you can get apps for it and if there is a list that I can look at?
Oct 22 11:26:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> are you familiar with using linux on a desktop or laptop? it's basically the same process
Oct 22 11:26:28 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> there's not really an "app store" like you find on iOS or android
Oct 22 11:27:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> though most of the interfaces you can use on the pinephone have a sort of "app store" looking thing that is a front end for the linux repositories
Oct 22 11:29:21 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <dobey> depends on which OS you run on it
Oct 22 11:29:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <dobey> for Ubuntu Touch there is https://open-store.io
Oct 22 15:42:52 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Anoop> Is there anyone I can chat with on the neural network & NPU side?
Oct 22 15:42:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Anoop> would love some advice 🙂

Oct 22 21:17:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <UniversalSuperBox> It does, but no one cares about this network right now.
Oct 22 21:23:54 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> the telegram channels are globally accessible, while you need to join the network to access the channels on IRC

Oct 22 23:04:10 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> there was actually spam on IRC yesterday. someone pointed a spambot at us through the tor network and blasted this channel with messages from about 100 clients
Oct 22 23:04:17 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> somehow it didn't make it across the bridge. i don't really know why.
Oct 22 23:04:41 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> but normally, yea IRC doesn't really get spam because it's too small of a network
Oct 22 23:05:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> actually... that wasn't public messages wasn't it. it was whispers and DMs just to me and abcde (one of the ops on the IRC network, for those not on it)
Oct 22 23:06:04 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> that would be why it didn't cross the bridge 🙂
Oct 22 23:07:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> but if you have IRC logs in this channel from about 32 hours ago, you'll see a shit ton of joins and then leaves from users with "real" names
Oct 22 23:08:23 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> the bot master seems to have done it to advertise their turkish dating chat site (i'm not kidding...) in their quit message
Oct 22 23:08:59 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> the bots weren't even spamming anything about that, their flood message was just keyboard mashing
Oct 22 23:09:07 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> whole thing is very confusing
Oct 22 23:10:31 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Danct12> @fireTwoOneNine what was the message? i didn't get it :P
Oct 22 23:10:46 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Danct12> but i see that the irc server seems to do it's job well
Oct 22 23:11:05 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Danct12> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/463285150898192384/901321809910181909/Screenshot_20211023_111057.png

Oct 22 23:12:43 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Danct12> @fireTwoOneNine as for joining over VPN or Tor, how about something like authentication over sasl?
Oct 22 23:12:52 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> as for the spam message, it was this
Oct 22 23:12:53 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/463285150898192384/901322257127841822/unknown.png
Oct 22 23:13:06 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Danct12> lolwhat
Oct 22 23:13:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Danct12> is the "byeee" quit message a part of the irc server kicking?
Oct 22 23:14:25 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <FatherlyFox> non-printable characters
Oct 22 23:14:52 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> it's unicode 0xFFFD
Oct 22 23:15:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <FatherlyFox> literal name being 'REPLACEMENT CHARACTER' lol
Oct 22 23:15:47 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> i can only assume it's a text encoding or padding fail
Oct 22 23:16:21 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <FatherlyFox> most likely encoding cause it looks like it was trying to do a line break but failed for some reason
Oct 22 23:17:38 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> that's more of a #pinebook question. but off the top of my head, suspend to RAM is a bit of a weird case where it kinda works and kinda doesn't
Oct 22 23:17:51 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> there will be people in that channel who can answer better than i can
Oct 22 23:18:47 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Danct12> @fireTwoOneNine but yeah, if you want you can setup sasl, so people that already had a nickserv account can login over tor or a vpn
Oct 22 23:19:12 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Danct12> this is what libera chat did and it seems to work
Oct 22 23:19:29 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> i might have to look into that if this becomes a recurring problem
Oct 22 23:20:03 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> higher priority for now is finding a way to stop (or at least slow down) the telegram spam
Oct 22 23:20:34 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> other than just using someone else's bot and hoping it doesn't get taken over maliciously (not an uncommon thing with telegram bots sadly)
Oct 22 23:22:06 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <FatherlyFox> Doesn't Telegram have an option to verify by CAPTCHA or something similar?
Oct 22 23:22:39 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> there are bots that do something like that
Oct 22 23:22:46 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> but it's not a native feature afaik
Oct 22 23:25:00 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <FatherlyFox> ahh ok, digging a little deeper that does seem to be the only option atm; can only hope that they implement a native feature for it 🤞
Oct 22 23:27:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> depends on how crazy we'd want to go
Oct 22 23:28:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> just going off a word blacklist would be fairly effective (the telegram spam is pretty consistent)
Oct 22 23:28:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> but it could backfire if a legit user says the wrong thing
Oct 22 23:30:13 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> hm, that looks like it could be useful. might be an excuse to play with making a telegram bot this weekend 🙂
Oct 22 23:31:28 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> thanks. looks pretty straightforward to use though
Oct 22 23:33:25 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> though it may still have the problem of the bridge catching a message before this bot could delete
Oct 22 23:33:46 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> especially if the classifier can take a while (i have no idea; basically asking you there 🙂 )
Oct 22 23:34:45 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> i was just wondering the same thing. not sure if matterbridge has such an option. technically we could custom compile with a hardcoded delay, but that's obviously non-ideal
Oct 22 23:35:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> license is the least of my worries there. MIT works just fine for me
Oct 22 23:37:03 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> looks like matterbridge has some delay controls for IRC, but that's it
Oct 22 23:38:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> lmao
Oct 22 23:38:25 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> the matterbridge config is already enough of a nightmare, thanks 🙂
Oct 22 23:38:51 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> pretty sure we have the biggest deployment of it anywhere
Oct 22 23:41:15 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> i suppose i could expand the bot scope to connect to all the chat platforms and delete on those platforms if necessary
Oct 22 23:41:22 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> i don't know
Oct 22 23:41:58 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> that's true
Oct 22 23:42:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> IRC already gets the short end of that stick
Oct 22 23:42:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> is that an irc 2.0 feature? 🙂
Oct 22 23:45:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> hell of a race condition to set up there. telegram bots have to get and send messages (or literally any action) over HTTP
Oct 22 23:45:21 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> don't know how often matterbridge polls that either
Oct 22 23:46:32 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> matterbridge does make use of the bot API for talking to telegram, yes
Oct 22 23:48:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> see ya
Oct 23 00:20:23 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <thanos the they/them engine> might also be useful to filter images
Oct 23 00:21:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <thanos the they/them engine> just delete messages that have an image matching the checksum of the damn elon musk twitter screenshots they send
Oct 23 00:21:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <thanos the they/them engine> I haven't checked but they probably do

Oct 23 18:27:10 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <PiZZaMartijn> the spammiest spam
Oct 23 19:09:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <pfeerick> Sounds like a perfect use for the rockpro64... mine is running as a NAS with to attached USB hard drives... has been running for nearly three years now 24x7... running docker containers, home assistant, and a few other bits an pieces... only issues I've had are usually self-inflicted ;)

Oct 24 03:50:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <ScrumpyJack> morning GMT
Oct 24 03:52:41 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <ScrumpyJack> what's the preferred way to get the HDMI output to fit a TV screen? disable_overscan in /boot/armbianEnv.txt didn't help.
Oct 24 03:52:42 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <ScrumpyJack> (rockpro64/stock Ubuntu/No X11)
Oct 24 04:11:03 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pfeerick> 2x4TB USB3 Seagate Expansion drives plugged directly into the the rockpro64 for bulk storage. Samsung NVMe on PCIe riser for secondary NAS storage, docker containers, etc. EMMC boot, with Samsung EVO microSD as backup (yet to need). Still have the USB2 and TypeC ports free if I really need to plug anything else in. Poor thing is still running 4.4 kernel from 2018... why fix what ain't broke 😆 .
Oct 24 04:16:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pfeerick> hm... thought it was the other way around... ok, so it's 2xUSB3 drives plugged into the 2xUSB2 ports, leaving the USB3 and TypeC free.
Oct 24 04:18:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pfeerick> For it's intended purpose (bulk video/music storage) the USB2 ports are more than enough for my needs, with the NVMe drive doing any high speed stuff, since it can basically saturate the ethernet link...
Oct 24 04:19:21 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pfeerick> Yes, although they and the RP64 are both common-powered via a 12v solar battery supply.
Oct 24 04:22:20 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Could also just plug both drives directly into the rockpro through the 3.0 type a and type c ports
Oct 24 04:22:59 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pfeerick> I have a second rockpro64, USB3 hub, and another pair of 4TB drives (they are the offline backups of the two that are in service)... I can always run that up and see what happens.
Oct 24 04:23:21 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pfeerick> That would defeat the "don't fix what ain't broke" adage 😛
Oct 24 12:11:31 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <ideasquarebased> I thought there are 0 taxes (re @p64protocolbot: [D] <Funeral> They don't live in delaware? 😄)

Oct 24 13:20:00 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <jackiemoore> I had a pine book pro I sold to a person in Europe who had me ship it to Delaware. They then forwarded it to the country where the buyer lives, think it was the Ukraine. (re @ideasquarebased: Why not to ship it to Delaware)
Oct 24 13:24:14 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> You still need to pay import taxes if you import it into the single market, even if it's forwarded via wherever. Otherwise it is tax evasion 😉
Oct 24 13:24:58 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> For countries like Russia they use forwarding services because customs block the orders otherwise
Oct 24 13:57:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> https://twitter.com/alyssarzg/status/1452082622876815361 heh TIL
Oct 24 14:21:23 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> the 3399 has pretty healthy memory bandwidth for what it is
Oct 24 14:21:32 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> the M1 is just.... well, the M1
Oct 24 14:21:50 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <spicyoreo> How do you even pay import tax i live in us
Oct 24 14:22:31 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <spicyoreo> I don't want to get in trouble  for not knowing  how to get my pinephone  paid for
Oct 24 14:26:59 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> the shipping company will ask you to pay tax if it's required
Oct 24 14:28:02 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <spicyoreo> That would probably  be by email then
Oct 24 14:31:59 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <spicyoreo> Thank you
Oct 24 15:29:23 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> spicyoreo: The US has no import tax, as far as I'm aware
Oct 24 15:29:46 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> The above discussion was about the EU import tax
Oct 24 15:30:29 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <cooncat44> Maybe google it
Oct 24 15:31:42 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <cooncat44> Customs Duty is a tariff or tax imposed on goods when transported across international borders. ... American Goods Returned (AGR) do not have to be declared, but you must be prepared to prove to U.S. Customs and Border Protection the articles are AGR or pay Customs duty. The Customs Duty Rate is a percentage.

Oct 24 15:32:34 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> That's not really helpful
Oct 24 15:32:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <cooncat44> Whatever bud
Oct 24 15:43:56 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> spicyoreo: all you have to pay is the shipping costs
Oct 24 15:48:24 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <koala> What is the "transit airport"? Is that the countries airport they're shipping it from? Or is it in my country? cause my watch just arrived at the transit country
Oct 24 15:51:38 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> that's up to your postal carrier but I assume it's the postal hub they're routing through
Oct 24 15:52:32 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <koala> Hmm, you think my watch will most likely be here this week or next week then?
Oct 24 16:05:12 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> probably? again, depends on your postal carrier :P
Oct 24 16:05:22 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> all you can do is wait, I'm afraid
Oct 24 16:10:26 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <koala> Gahhh the thing i hate doing the most too lol

Oct 26 15:05:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> hey lads, do you think the rk3588 will be pin compatible with the 3568?
Oct 26 15:14:03 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> most likely not
Oct 26 15:14:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> i don't exactly have datasheets for the 3588, but it almost certainly has more peripherals, which means it needs more pins
Oct 26 15:19:07 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> :(
Oct 26 15:19:33 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> I wanted to try to get a head start designing something

Oct 26 16:42:28 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <UniversalSuperBox> If the order has shipped, you almost certainly are not receiving a PinePhone Pro.

Oct 26 20:52:23 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <CalcProgrammer1> the real question - which comes first, the steam deck or the pinephone pro?

Oct 26 21:14:24 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <NULL> steam deck
Oct 26 21:21:45 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Randall> I'm wondering if we'll see people using pinephone pros with keyboard attachments running as input devices for the steam deck
Oct 26 21:35:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <eNos> Do we know the release window for Pinephone Pro Explorer Edition?
Oct 26 21:44:26 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Cyastis> Whenever half life 3 gets released

Oct 26 22:27:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <ayayagames> Explorer edition is coming either in the next couple months this year or the start of next year
Oct 26 23:13:20 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <eNos> I saw the Interview about the PPP, so hopefully Luke knew what he was saying when he claimed that Pine had gotten enough inventory to weather the chip shortage and that we don't end up with "where is the PS5" situation.
Oct 27 02:50:07 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <ayayagames> Lmao the ps5
Oct 27 02:50:26 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <ayayagames> nothing will be that bad again

Oct 27 11:46:58 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <romadr> Hello, I plan to use pine64 hardware to validate a new block-chain in a sustainable way with low power devices such as RP64 and coming soon Quartz64. I read  brand and logo guidelines https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/PINE64_brand_and_logo and I was wondering whom to ask. Thanks for your answer.
Oct 27 11:49:14 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> assuming it's non-commercial, i think that it's allowable as "software [that] is compatible with PINE64 hardware"
Oct 27 12:01:34 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Exaeta> As far as trademarks in the US, you can use the term "Pine64" as long as there is no "likelihood of confusion". E.g. you can say "Tested to work with Pine64" but not use Pine64 in the name of the project (generally speaking). The logo might be usable under fair use but it depends on the circumstances.

Oct 27 13:31:16 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Exaeta> Very brief overview here
Oct 27 13:33:00 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <Panuozzo77> Hey guys, is there any other thing similar to the Pinebook Pro?
Oct 27 13:33:02 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <Panuozzo77> I mean, a laptop with Arm64 + Linux and not Android
Oct 27 13:33:25 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> Just ask and you're good to go, I don't know why this has to be discussed. The rules were written because of 1-2 people severely misbehaving, while everyone else does not. 😄
Oct 27 13:34:02 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> Panuozzo77: that maybe fits better in the offtopic channel
Oct 27 13:34:28 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <Panuozzo77> Hi guys
Oct 27 13:35:07 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <Panuozzo77> Where can I find it? (re @p64protocolbot: [D] <Funeral> Panuozzo77: that maybe fits better in the offtopic channel)
Oct 27 13:36:17 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <Panuozzo77> Where can I find it?
Oct 27 13:36:17 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <Panuozzo77> Edit: found (re @p64protocolbot: [D] <Funeral> Panuozzo77: that maybe fits better in the offtopic channel)
Oct 27 13:36:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> https://t.me/pine64offtopic
Oct 27 13:45:31 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Exaeta> we have a channel for offtopic in discord
Oct 27 13:45:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Exaeta> is it not connected?
Oct 27 13:46:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Exaeta> not sure how telegram works
Oct 27 14:12:14 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Exaeta> I have a question, why does pine use SD cards when SD is a proprietary format?
Oct 27 14:12:52 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Exaeta> Shouldn't we use an open format?
Oct 27 14:13:14 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Exaeta> Like, assuming Pine wants to support open source
Oct 27 14:14:18 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <UniversalSuperBox> Do you have an example
Oct 27 14:15:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <UniversalSuperBox> Especially one that would be supported by the hardware the Pine64 uses
Oct 27 14:16:07 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <UniversalSuperBox> Sometimes the truly open solution is not the best, nor is it at all reasonable.
Oct 27 14:17:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <UniversalSuperBox> And a "but not *everything* you use is open" litmus test will only mean that you get to throw away all your computers and stare out the window for the rest of your life
Oct 27 14:17:17 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <Strit> What would be an open alternative to the SD card?
Oct 27 14:17:42 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <Strit> Taking what the SoC's can boot into account.
Oct 27 14:42:27 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> SD has a slower spi mode that's open
Oct 27 14:43:38 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> although who cares because absolutely no interfaces are open anyway
Oct 27 14:44:07 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> although who cares because almost no interfaces are open anyway

Oct 27 18:44:03 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> something might have to
Oct 27 19:02:05 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> no rush, i haven't had time to do anything with it
Oct 27 19:04:24 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> if you want that's fine, but my hexchat has been logging for months 😉
Oct 27 19:07:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> nope, this one has the most by far
Oct 27 19:08:47 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> i probably ought to mention though that a telegram captcha bot is probably more effective (and easier) than the spam classifier
Oct 27 19:09:00 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> preventive rather than reactive, and means the spam doesn't get to IRC 😉
Oct 27 19:09:06 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> yes
Oct 27 19:09:22 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> i tried to start one up a few days ago but ran into technical issues
Oct 27 19:10:16 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> technically yes, but bots could still find the invites
Oct 27 19:10:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> we're beyond the point of obscurity being effective
Oct 27 19:11:26 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> standard telegram background noise for groups of our sizes, afaik
Oct 27 19:11:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> would be nice if the telegram devs could fix their own shit, but ya know 🙂
Oct 27 19:13:34 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <UniversalSuperBox> You'll never get rid of all of the spam on Telegram. But a captcha bot can get rid of a very good portion of it.
Oct 27 19:13:36 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> a bit of column A, a bit of column B. but from what i've read, most of the bots are programmed very lazily
Oct 27 19:13:53 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> the spam bots i mean
Oct 27 19:14:04 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <UniversalSuperBox> Much like you still get a bit of noise in your gmail inbox, even though the scale is way different.
Oct 27 19:15:02 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <UniversalSuperBox> congratulations
Oct 27 19:15:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> the end goal probably will be to have a captcha bot to handle most of the spam, and the classifier bot to clean up the rest
Oct 27 19:17:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> we'd already have the captcha bot, if mongodb actually built for arm64 (outside of niche cases)
Oct 27 19:17:42 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> so i need to go looking for a different bot (because i really don't want to custom compile that for a production server)
Oct 27 19:59:51 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <beingviking> Hi! I’m living in Korea. If I buy a pinephone ($149.99) now, Would it dispatch late november? I hope I haven’t been too late.
Oct 27 20:07:23 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> that's a decent estimate

Oct 28 21:16:05 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <ayayagames> there are a few but i forgot
Oct 28 21:16:16 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <ayayagames> and you have to use your token lol
Oct 28 21:16:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <ayayagames> and they will ban you if found out lmao
Oct 28 21:16:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> There was cchat-gtk but I don't think it's being particularly actively developed
Oct 28 21:16:52 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Also yeah custom clients are against TOS
Oct 28 21:17:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> the discord client is just a bunch of JS, has nobody gotten it working on ARM?
Oct 28 21:17:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> also, i think you could run the android version in anbox or something
Oct 28 21:17:59 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <ayayagames> browser works lol
Oct 28 21:18:13 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <ayayagames> anbox is ass lol
Oct 28 21:18:53 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> they collect a *lot* of analytics
Oct 28 21:19:04 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> under the /science url
Oct 28 21:19:10 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Anbox runs really slowly, the official client has some proprietary files in it that I guess nobody has managed to decompile?
Oct 28 21:19:13 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> also they dont like the automation of user accounts
Oct 28 21:19:15 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <ayayagames> waydroid is better from what i hear but i hate IOS and android even thoughi used an iphone 5 till the PP camne out amd have daily drove the pinephone for 2 years now
Oct 28 21:19:29 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Someone made an open source electron wrapper for the website that I've heard works decently but eh
Oct 28 21:19:51 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> the official desktop client just loads the website anyway lmao
Oct 28 21:20:03 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> It does some other special things as well
Oct 28 21:20:36 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> yeah, for stuff like video streaming and detecting background button presses for push to talk
Oct 28 21:21:26 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> hey lads, anyone know when the allwinner t723 will be released
Oct 28 21:21:45 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> it's supposed to be basically the same as the rk3566
Oct 28 21:23:03 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I can't find much info on it
Oct 28 21:23:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> it's supposedly coming out in 2021

Oct 29 14:06:36 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <kman> Okay. And if anyone from the site has a salvaged PBP small side board i would appreciate adding it to the store. My USB ports have been broken for a while on one side of the laptop
Oct 29 14:07:27 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <kman> I know the PBP isnt in production but this is something that seems really basic and there’s probably some nuked boards in the shop that have working spare parts  that could be added to the store
Oct 29 14:09:45 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <lukasz> @Crafty fixed, not sure if it will propagate across platforms or not

Oct 30 00:41:53 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> oh neat you're in this server too
Oct 30 00:50:46 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I don't think so
Oct 30 00:51:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Maybe have a look at the radxa zero or the banana pi m2 zero
Oct 30 00:51:41 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Is the rockpro64 just like not supported very much? Some of the wiki info seems like it might be outdated the android builds 'boot' at best and I had something I wanted to use it for with an android application and I guess I didn't do enough research before picking one up lol.
Oct 30 00:52:20 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> It should be able to run a regular mainline kernel
Oct 30 00:52:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> @Segfault like roll a version of android with mainline kernel or?
Oct 30 00:53:02 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> In theory most linux distros should "just work" as long as they have an ARM image
Oct 30 00:53:27 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> yeah my main gripe is dual display port (DP over USB-C+HDMI) at the same time
Oct 30 00:53:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> yeah my main gripe is dual display support (DP over USB-C+HDMI) at the same time
Oct 30 00:53:43 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Yeah that's gonna need a custom kernel
Oct 30 00:53:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Like 7.1->8.0->9.0 though...
Oct 30 00:53:50 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Hell even with a custom kernel that barely works at the moment
Oct 30 00:54:02 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> 7.1 worked great, ran great it felt good.
Oct 30 00:54:06 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> no dual display.
Oct 30 00:54:10 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> 8.0 was slow as garbage.
Oct 30 00:54:21 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Pine devices generally don't get very good android support unfortunately, I don't think much of the community is particularly interested in it outside of verifying that the hardware works
Oct 30 00:54:27 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> 9.0 ran but was flashing the screen non-stop, was able to drive DP and HDMI at the same time but mirrored image
Oct 30 00:54:28 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> lol
Oct 30 00:54:33 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I see
Oct 30 00:54:42 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Even the pinephone? lol
Oct 30 00:54:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> There were some efforts for android on the pinephone but I haven't heard anything about them lately
Oct 30 00:55:13 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Heh
Oct 30 00:55:34 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I guess I'll look into rolling my own android support if I continue going down this path.
Oct 30 00:55:52 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> despite dsimic's disagreement
Oct 30 00:57:13 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> When you have software that you want to run and don't 'own' /didn't write yourself or have source to that are only compatible with android other than antbox I don't see much choice.
Oct 30 01:00:31 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Because I need exposed GPIO with at minimum two UART interfaces available, and dual display support.
Oct 30 01:00:59 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> and I don't want to rely on software UART over GPIO or bitbanging either.
Oct 30 01:01:46 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I'm trying to come up with a drop in replacement for another board that's less powerful and runs android/some android applications on it
Oct 30 01:01:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> in order to allow those applications to run at higher resolutions on one of the displays without lagging.
Oct 30 01:02:36 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Current board utilizes an H6 clocking the cortex cores at 1.8ghz
Oct 30 01:02:56 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Ah yes the forgotten H6 :P
Oct 30 01:02:59 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> So I figured the RK3399 might do nicely.
Oct 30 01:03:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> The original board also only has 1gb of RAM.
Oct 30 01:03:22 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> so the RAM upgrade was just a an addition to that and the poor performance.
Oct 30 01:03:45 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> The idea was to fab a PCB adapter to breakout the GPIO into the connectors supported by the original device so it was literally a drop in replacement.
Oct 30 01:04:28 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> but alas without proper android and dual display not gonna have a ton of luck.
Oct 30 01:04:39 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I'm sure I'd get crucified for suggesting it but the RPI 4 could potentially also do the job, not sure if it's got a decent Android image available or not
Oct 30 01:04:42 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I've got a few boards, this was just the first to arrive out of the few I'm looking at.
Oct 30 01:04:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Nah, there's an unofficial port of lineage OS for it afaik
Oct 30 01:05:00 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> and it doesn't work well
Oct 30 01:05:03 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> worse than this infact.
Oct 30 01:05:06 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> :/
Oct 30 01:05:07 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> does the vim3 have android?
Oct 30 01:05:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> could be an option
Oct 30 01:05:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Does it do video over USB-C?
Oct 30 01:05:54 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> It only seems to have a single HDMI port
Oct 30 01:06:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Oh wait it has MIPI-DSI, good luck getting that working though
Oct 30 01:06:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> haha
Oct 30 01:07:14 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I mean, initially I was crazy enough to think I'd find a board with LVDS on it...
Oct 30 01:07:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Well the rockpro has eDP
Oct 30 01:08:05 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I'm not entirely sure how you'd *use* it, in Linux it's probably just a dts edit, in Android... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Oct 30 01:08:13 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> edp is basically the same as dp
Oct 30 01:08:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Yea, I also wouldn't know how to go from eDP to LVDS (Only had luck finding adapters to do the opposite)
Oct 30 01:09:36 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> ah I know how to do that actually
Oct 30 01:09:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> ptn3460
Oct 30 01:09:54 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Actually wow the rockpro has 4 display outputs, DSI, eDP, HDMI and USB-C
Oct 30 01:09:56 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> used one in my diy'd laptop
Oct 30 01:10:00 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Can only do two at once though :(
Oct 30 01:11:22 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Would require making an adapter lol.... I don't know PCB design very well will be the first time trying to build such an adapter and that would complicate what I'd have to do heavily.
Oct 30 01:11:43 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I only need two at once lol 😦
Oct 30 01:11:56 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Does the armbian build support USB-C -> DP and HDMI at the same time?
Oct 30 01:13:12 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I don't know much about what would cause it not to work kernel wise, so I'm probably in over my head if I did go down the route of trying to add the support for it in android... but what actually causes it not to work? You mentioned custom kernel; I imagine drivers?
Oct 30 01:14:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> it's out of stock but this is what I have
Oct 30 01:14:45 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32835211459.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.27424c4d3IPJco
Oct 30 01:14:59 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Electr0Lyte> same dts but it has its own partition
Oct 30 01:15:10 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Electr0Lyte> dtbo i think ?
Oct 30 01:15:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> dtbos aren't really a thing outside of the rpi
Oct 30 01:15:59 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> That listing title is so confusing lol, says it does the opposite shows on the board it doing what "we" would want, and then in the description says it the proper way.
Oct 30 01:17:27 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> calling it a "driver board" looks like there's a good amount of listings though; https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001369234799.html
Oct 30 01:18:45 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Also I'm not sure what cable you need for eDP on the rockpro
Oct 30 01:19:39 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I don't even know if there's a standard for the mainboard side of eDP cables
Oct 30 01:19:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Well I still don't know if using eDP over the USB-C->DP would solve my problem of wanting two displays anyway.
Oct 30 01:19:45 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> lol
Oct 30 01:20:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> At this point what I wanted to do probably isn't worth the effort if I'm being honest, at least not based on the lack of performance increase I saw running the software on the rockpro
Oct 30 01:20:45 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Getting an install with reliably working DP alt mode will need you to use the BSP kernel most likely
Oct 30 01:20:59 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Unless that was more related to the android drivers/support than it was the hardware itself.
Oct 30 01:21:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Another thing I'd noticed, 9.0 made my CPU fan not spin
Oct 30 01:21:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> lol
Oct 30 01:21:12 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> maybe bad DTS.
Oct 30 01:22:24 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I just thought maybe the rockpro64 wasn't well supported considering it doesn't seem like it's talked about much, and I assume rock64 is another board as far as channels in here.
Oct 30 01:22:38 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> saw the #quartz64 was the 'newer' board but seems to have weaker hardware?
Oct 30 01:22:43 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> correct me if I'm worng.
Oct 30 01:22:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> *wrong
Oct 30 01:23:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> eDP cabling is pretty much standardized
Oct 30 01:23:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> there's "30 pin" and "40 pin" cables
Oct 30 01:23:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Yeah on the display side of things
Oct 30 01:23:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> What about the rockpro itself
Oct 30 01:23:45 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> It's just a flat flex connector
Oct 30 01:24:13 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> i haven't really ever looked at that, but i'm assuming it's the same connector as on the display side
Oct 30 01:24:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Nope
Oct 30 01:25:04 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> eDP cables typically terminate like this on the display side

Oct 30 01:26:29 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> yea you're right. i forgot about that. went to go look at a spare eDP panel i have sitting around 🙂
Oct 30 01:27:12 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> it is 30pin on the RP64 though, and i do see straight through adapter cables
Oct 30 01:27:20 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> i would assume that is the right cable
Oct 30 01:27:27 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> it wouldn't be something custom 😉
Oct 30 01:27:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Someone should try it :)
Oct 30 01:28:20 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> i'd get one of those cables, but that spare display is probably a bit too power hungry (15.6")
Oct 30 01:28:20 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I've got a quartz and an eDP panel somewhere, if noone's tried it by the time video output works on the quartz I'll buy a cable and give it a go
Oct 30 01:28:50 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I'll have a look at the schematic, maybe see what regulator is powering that connector
Oct 30 01:29:14 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> (I'm doing a lot of schematic checking today lol)
Oct 30 01:29:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> if 15.6" is too power hungry in my application it def would not work lol
Oct 30 01:30:00 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> i'm guessing there. i'm just concerned about the backlight power consumption
Oct 30 01:30:18 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> need to check schematic for RP and datasheet for a given panel
Oct 30 01:30:20 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Most large signage displays probably use an external power source for the backlight
Oct 30 01:30:53 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> This one is driven directly off the board, given the board gets supplied additional power from a power unit
Oct 30 01:31:20 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> My plan was actually to do something stupid and go USB-C->HDMI (Or DP->HDMI off USB-C) into an LVDS driver board.
Oct 30 01:31:26 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> because the driver board takes an external power source
Oct 30 01:31:27 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> It seems like on the rockpro the edp port can draw power from VCCA_0V9 and VCC1V8_DVP
Oct 30 01:31:36 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> to feed the needed power into the display
Oct 30 01:32:07 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Oh wait it seems like backlight power comes from EDPAUXP
Oct 30 01:32:21 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> i'm pretty sure display backlights run off a beefier rail than 1v8...
Oct 30 01:32:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Which from what I can tell draws from VCC3V3_S0
Oct 30 01:33:16 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> This seems to be the eDP connector on the rockpro
Oct 30 01:33:16 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/463285150898192384/903894303930195988/unknown.png
Oct 30 01:33:47 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Apparently VCC3V3_S0 comes from the RK808
Oct 30 01:33:47 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> oh ok, that backlight rail is straight from 12V Vcc
Oct 30 01:33:54 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Wait 12V?
Oct 30 01:33:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> that's all i was really worried about
Oct 30 01:33:58 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Oh yeah there it is lol
Oct 30 01:34:22 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> so as long as your power brick is up to the task, should be a non-issue
Oct 30 01:34:24 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Yep
Oct 30 01:34:33 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I'd imagine most panels don't draw more than 5W or so
Oct 30 01:34:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> 12v is what's being driven into this LVDS display I'm referring to
Oct 30 01:34:56 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I think it has two separate 12v inputs though
Oct 30 01:35:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I doubt the LVDS connector itself is rated for whatever crazy wattage those big signage panels use if that's what you're talking about
Oct 30 01:35:54 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> dsimic: bah that's yet another reason the next PBP should use a 2s battery config
Oct 30 01:36:38 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> a big commercial sign panel is definitely not getting powered via LVDS
Oct 30 01:36:50 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> at least not the main drive power. there may be logic power via that
Oct 30 01:37:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> @fireTwoOneNine what were those generic cables you were talking about?
Oct 30 01:38:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> i just found them on aliexp https://www.aliexpress.com/i/32756336009.html
Oct 30 01:38:34 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> LOL
Oct 30 01:38:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/463285150898192384/903895636464762910/unknown.png
Oct 30 01:39:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Well you're right in that they seem to be a direct pass through, I wonder what the pinout of the eDP connector itself is
Oct 30 01:39:39 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/463285150898192384/903895907353903124/iu.png
Oct 30 01:39:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Excuse my ignorance but when is the rk sd tool used? For most of these things I've just been using etcher.
Oct 30 01:40:03 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> are there actually cases where you'd want/need that sd tool
Oct 30 01:40:03 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> you don't need to worry about that tool
Oct 30 01:40:13 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Yeah sure enough that pinout looks like a match
Oct 30 01:40:17 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> all the images we have are made to be directly flashed to SD or eMMC
Oct 30 01:40:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Niiice so those generic cables should work great then
Oct 30 01:41:12 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I like how you both just went down an eDP rabbit hole out of curiosity of how it's used lol.
Oct 30 01:41:21 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> or implemented rather.
Oct 30 01:41:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> It's good to know these things :P
Oct 30 01:41:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I'm not judging
Oct 30 01:41:52 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> The amount of crap I know about android I didn't a month ago is beyond what I wanted to ever know about it...
Oct 30 01:41:58 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> because 'it's good to know these things'
Oct 30 01:42:00 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> lol
Oct 30 01:42:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I'm more of a software guy than hardware though.
Oct 30 01:42:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> i jumped into this conversation late and didn't read the context until later 😛
Oct 30 01:42:33 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Actually fire you might find some of the scrollback in #pinebook somewhat interesting, we discovered why the main-daughterboard cable in the PBP is so damn wide
Oct 30 01:43:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> So again, excuse my ignorance but, is fire not one of the people who designed some of this stuff?
Oct 30 01:43:23 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I think they were mostly designed externally
Oct 30 01:43:59 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> afraid i'm not. i'm pretty knowledgeable on a lot of the hardware (and designing new hardware), but for P64 i'm basically just a sysadmin
Oct 30 01:44:07 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Also I must say, trying to get one of these running for the first time... was nerve racking.
Oct 30 01:44:22 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I don't have an emmc module yet; and the wiki is basically 'if your lights blink it works'
Oct 30 01:44:23 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> lol
Oct 30 01:44:29 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> so I plug an sd card in with an android image
Oct 30 01:44:43 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> have no idea how to establish UART except that the wiki tells you not to do it prior to U-Boot SPL
Oct 30 01:44:47 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> for the rockchip
Oct 30 01:44:51 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> so had no idea what was going wrong
Oct 30 01:44:56 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> or the fact I had to push a power button
Oct 30 01:44:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> lol
Oct 30 01:45:12 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Huh I thought the rockpro powered on as soon as it got power, the quartz definitely does
Oct 30 01:45:27 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> the rp64 definitely powers on when it gets plugged in
Oct 30 01:45:33 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> There's power for sure, the ethernet starts lighting up; but I've had to hit the power button
Oct 30 01:45:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> every time I've loaded a new image
Oct 30 01:45:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> but the android images may be weird, idk
Oct 30 01:45:52 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> This was on armbian too
Oct 30 01:45:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Oct 30 01:45:58 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> when android wasn't working I went with armbian
Oct 30 01:46:28 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Nothing happened till I hit power button, then fan started spinning and I was excited/enamored because I didn't get a brick lol
Oct 30 01:46:43 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Then somewhat impatiently waited for HDMI to come up
Oct 30 01:47:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> saw the armbian login screen
Oct 30 01:47:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> actually maybe RP does need you to press the power button. it's been a while since i used mine 😒
Oct 30 01:47:16 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> and went back to the android builds
Oct 30 01:47:53 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> anyway, the docs around the android builds are probably sparse and archaic -- they were mostly just test images when the device was brand new
Oct 30 01:48:04 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> very few people use them
Oct 30 01:48:12 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I've realized as much haha.
Oct 30 01:49:03 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> doesn't even auto-resize the partitions lol
Oct 30 01:49:04 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/463285150898192384/903898272345759754/unknown.png
Oct 30 01:49:05 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> The unfortunate thing is I was skeptical about other boards because their android support was advertised as pretty much being 'unofficial' saw the pine wiki and was like wow there's a lot here, this must be an actively supported board and they have android builds
Oct 30 01:49:14 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> and the wiki was well organized
Oct 30 01:49:36 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> deceiving bastards with your organized stuff lol
Oct 30 01:49:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> you're in a tiny minority needing android on an SBC 😉
Oct 30 01:49:52 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I know 😦
Oct 30 01:50:04 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> If I had a choice it wouldn't be android lol.
Oct 30 01:51:14 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> if those old test android images don't work out for you, you honestly might be better off running waydroid on linux lmao
Oct 30 01:51:25 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> :reeee:
Oct 30 01:51:26 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> never heard of waydroid
Oct 30 01:51:29 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> is there performance impact?
Oct 30 01:51:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Anbox but less crap performance
Oct 30 01:51:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> ^ that
Oct 30 01:51:45 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> The complication would be dual display
Oct 30 01:51:58 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I'm not sure how performance compares to native
Oct 30 01:52:17 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Also USB-C support on mainline linux is "a bit dodgy" at the moment
Oct 30 01:52:21 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> waydroid supposedly works pretty damn well on the pinephone pro, which is also RK3399 (downclocked from RP64, even)
Oct 30 01:52:32 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> PPP is also running a single display at 720p
Oct 30 01:52:38 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> lame
Oct 30 01:52:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> the problem with waydroid if anything would be CPU not GPU
Oct 30 01:53:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> The SBC world is weird right now.
Oct 30 01:53:12 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> It might work on a BSP kernel but don't even ask me how you'd get the blob Mali driver working
Oct 30 01:53:22 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> You go either pi4/pine or some dev board
Oct 30 01:53:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> or some really weird chineese board supported by one guy
Oct 30 01:53:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> who posts a ton of random source on github
Oct 30 01:53:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> and hope it can compile
Oct 30 01:53:38 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> lol
Oct 30 01:54:06 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> That's personal experience thus far
Oct 30 01:54:10 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Things have improved a lot lately but yeah it's still a bit archaic, especially if you can't deal with missing certain features like USB-C alt mode
Oct 30 01:54:32 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Well even if USB-C isn't there if I can go eDP to LVDS and still draw enough power for it to work.
Oct 30 01:54:34 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> fwiw USB alt mode *does* work on mainline, it's just very unreliable, probably not ideal for signage lol
Oct 30 01:54:46 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> This isn't signage, but yeah..
Oct 30 01:54:47 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> lol
Oct 30 01:55:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Yep eDP to LVDS would probably work well, the main problem then would just be reliability of waydroid and whether it performs well enough
Oct 30 01:55:13 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> So to give an idea of what this is; it's a virtual pinball machine.
Oct 30 01:55:15 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> RK3399 is quick but it's not magic
Oct 30 01:55:34 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> and the reason for two displays is the "DMD (Dot Matrix Display)" despite it being an actual monitor in this case.
Oct 30 01:55:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> where the game renders to a 'presentation api' in android
Oct 30 01:55:46 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> to put that onto that second screen
Oct 30 01:55:54 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Huh that's pretty cool
Oct 30 01:56:07 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> the main screen is the play area where you see the 'play field' and the ball moving around and such
Oct 30 01:56:21 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Actually I wonder if the eDP output would work with Android
Oct 30 01:56:24 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> They shipped them with 720p, and 1080p runs fine on a lot of it except this one that emulates actual pinball roms
Oct 30 01:56:31 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> so I'm guessing heavier compute involved.
Oct 30 01:56:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Specifically the Android 7 image you said performed fine
Oct 30 01:56:49 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> it seemed like it did, or better than the rest.
Oct 30 01:56:53 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> HDMI seemed more functional
Oct 30 01:57:02 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> and my CPU fan worked
Oct 30 01:57:02 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> lol
Oct 30 01:57:04 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Yeah now I'm curious if eDP would work with that image
Oct 30 01:58:02 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Yeah, so; in some cases some people replace their display with non LVDS ones
Oct 30 01:58:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> dsimic: Yeah no rush on this, it's more of an experiment than anything.
Oct 30 01:58:31 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I just wanted to see if things -could- run better.
Oct 30 01:58:58 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> These pinball things shipped with 1080p displays but drove 720p at software level
Oct 30 01:59:07 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Everyone's eagerly awaiting dp alt mode being fixed lol
Oct 30 01:59:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Oh I meant than the stock PCB.
Oct 30 01:59:10 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> heh.
Oct 30 01:59:47 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I have no idea, I've just started using it tonight.
Oct 30 01:59:50 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I think it stays powered down
Oct 30 01:59:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> but I'm using the button to turn it off.
Oct 30 02:00:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Segfault some other cool things about these virtual pinball things is that they have feedback mechanisms via push solenoids.
Oct 30 02:00:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> That's why the 2 UART interfaces are necessary
Oct 30 02:00:46 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> one accepts input the other gets written to for the feedback mechanism to be fired.
Oct 30 02:00:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Oh I see
Oct 30 02:00:49 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> when bumpers/slingshots are hit.
Oct 30 02:01:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I'd have expected things like that to use I2C
Oct 30 02:01:16 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> There's a gyro hooked to i2c
Oct 30 02:01:18 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> but that's about it
Oct 30 02:01:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I don't know that I've 'discovered' any issues lol.
Oct 30 02:01:50 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I tried to run android, and was told android doesn't work 😛
Oct 30 02:02:02 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I imagine a lot of those 'problems' are isolated to android itself
Oct 30 02:02:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> or the kernels being used in those builds
Oct 30 02:02:47 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> If the program you were running was able to work on Linux I'd say run BSP Debian, that way dp alt mode works perfectly
Oct 30 02:02:50 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Yeah, I'm not complaining about it just saying that I don't really expect those issues to be fixed lol.
Oct 30 02:03:06 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I'm gonna try waydroid on armbian
Oct 30 02:03:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> The waydroid part should work, I think it's a mainline kernel so dp alt mode may or may not
Oct 30 02:03:46 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> As for performance in waydroid... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Oct 30 02:04:21 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Like I said this is more curiosity at the moment than anything.
Oct 30 02:04:34 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Can't hurt to try
Oct 30 02:04:43 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> If it worked and did things better than what was there, was going to open source a PCB design that had the stock IDC connector/JST from the system converted to the GPIO
Oct 30 02:04:54 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> and make some software to help dump/port the original over to the 'new' board.
Oct 30 02:04:56 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> whatever that may be
Oct 30 02:05:13 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> so it was 'plug and play' for the most part.
Oct 30 02:16:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Also for clarification Android 9.0 (and whatever kernel it was using) was weird... it actually mirrored the image on both but made the HDMI distorted at the same time (green).

Oct 30 13:36:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Frostclaw20> Hi
Oct 30 13:48:47 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Blockycleric> Hello.
Oct 30 14:18:43 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Synth> It seems that after I updated sxmo, the button bindings have gotten messed up. Anyone have any clue on how to fix this?
Oct 30 14:32:17 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <qnerop> 
Oct 30 14:57:23 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <ayayagames> If it’s mostly in suspend mode and it should last all day
Oct 30 14:57:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <ayayagames> Especially with the keyboard plus battery
Oct 30 15:00:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> Jaguar: the pro is not released yet, the first devices ship to the developers in December. So you won't find any numbers. Megi had numbers for the non-S variant of the RK3399 but those numbers are only of limited use
Oct 30 15:00:46 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <Oscar> @Moderator telegram spam
Oct 30 15:02:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> That would be for the best. For now you could only get wrong estimates
Oct 30 15:02:15 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> in both directions
Oct 30 15:04:42 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <ayayagames> The only thing that’s missing is Bluetooth headphone calling capability
Oct 30 15:05:46 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <ayayagames> Granted I’ve only had a single pair of Mic Bluetooth headphones, And they say it should work but it’s not it’s probably a Linux thing or something in the Bluetooth stack but audiobooks and everything else works so I just can’t pick up a call nor get sound from my headphones via call

Oct 30 16:34:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <kunrooted> when will Pinebook Pro be available again?
Oct 30 16:57:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Cody> the pinephone convergence package will ship in two shipments, right? i received my pinephone, but not the dock
Oct 30 17:01:29 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> @Cody did you order the 3GB or the 2GB version?
Oct 30 17:01:38 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Cody> 3GB
Oct 30 17:01:54 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Cody> as far as i know, convergence edition is the 3GB pinephone with a usb-c dock
Oct 30 17:02:22 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> The USB-C dock is underneath the plastic shell in which the phone lays on top
Oct 30 17:03:07 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Cody> :LaughLiz: I'm an idiot. Thank you
Oct 30 17:03:14 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> No worries
Oct 30 21:00:45 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <NULL> lol

Oct 31 13:05:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <peac> hi, I have received an email from sales@pine64.org requesting info for the second time and i'm not sure if they receive my emails. Is there someone from the team who could help ?
Oct 31 13:06:47 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <Strit> This chat is community run. There are no representatives from Pine64 company here.
Oct 31 13:07:21 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> Well, technically there are and we can also forward stuff to the right people 😛
Oct 31 13:08:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> But mail issues is usually just the long response time and/or mishaps
Oct 31 13:10:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <peac> basically they asked me to confirm an order on the 25th which i answered within 15 minutes and I just received the same email stating "2nd notice" in scary red
Oct 31 13:15:13 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> We can try to ask @GAMELASTER to look into it as friendly as possible :>>
Oct 31 13:20:13 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <gamiee> hi @peac I will contact you in DM
Oct 31 13:20:18 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <peac> thank you !
Oct 31 13:20:24 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> thanks mr gamiee

Oct 31 14:42:20 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> ooh
Oct 31 14:42:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> sure
Oct 31 14:44:14 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <kunrooted> dsimic: thx for the info (re @p64protocolbot: [I] <dsimic> that's still unknown, unfortunately)
Oct 31 14:44:29 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <kunrooted> I think I'll get Pinecil for now haha
Oct 31 14:45:20 <kj7rrv>	Right now it assumes that all messages are from the bot (so the logs need to be run through grep P64ProtocolBot before training)
Oct 31 14:51:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <kunrooted> oh Yeah, that's right
Oct 31 14:51:36 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <kunrooted> I just wanted to learn hardware hacking to be honest and Pinecil seems as the most reasonable choice
