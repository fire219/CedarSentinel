Sep 22 00:51:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@mbohun> Is there actually a plan for a Pine64 "car dash-cam recording system" ?

Sep 22 00:52:00 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@mbohun> - i would really love to build one with night vision / heat sensor for wildlife detection/avoidance (kangaroos, deer, wombats, echidnas, foxes, etc. EVERYWHERE! )
Sep 22 00:52:38 <phone>	hey aussie ;-)  one would assume it would start with a pinecube thing
Sep 22 00:53:25 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@mbohun> yes, that is what i meant, pine64 seems to have all the different parts

Sep 22 17:15:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> Hi guys!!
Sep 22 17:15:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> i have a question about shipping
Sep 22 17:15:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Funeral> Spit it out
Sep 22 17:16:24 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> if i ordered one pinephone and 2x pinetime, How can I find out when it will be at my address?
Sep 22 17:16:46 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> date field on site not working
Sep 22 17:17:03 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Funeral> You could order the PinePhone only individually, without the pinetime. For both orders you will get a mail with the tracking number once it ships
Sep 22 17:17:10 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Funeral> Which date field?
Sep 22 17:17:39 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Funeral> Or are you asking how long it would roughly take?
Sep 22 17:17:51 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> I have a flight on the 9th of next month it has to catch up
Sep 22 17:18:15 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> we can say from today until october 8
Sep 22 17:18:21 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Funeral> They ship from China and the PinePhone is usually a pre-order depending on your location
Sep 22 17:18:51 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> i'm in pennsylvania
Sep 22 17:19:12 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Funeral> Then it also depends on the shipping method, courier or slow shipping üòõ
Sep 22 17:20:01 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> May I know roughly how long it takes in America?
Sep 22 17:27:10 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Funeral> Nah, that's not possible
Sep 22 17:27:16 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Funeral> 3 to 40 days
Sep 22 17:28:45 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Funeral> Like said, it's a pre-order, there are different shipping methods
Sep 22 17:28:46 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> OMG
Sep 22 17:28:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> thanks man!
Sep 22 17:29:00 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> thats bad for me :(
Sep 22 17:29:17 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> i want to get pinephone but i will leave from USA
Sep 22 17:29:26 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> and you are not shipping Turkey yet
Sep 22 17:30:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Funeral> Well, did you order courier or standard and when?
Sep 22 17:31:21 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> I haven't done it yet, I'm looking for the fastest way
Sep 22 17:31:51 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Funeral> courier is fast but it's a pre-order üòÑ
Sep 22 17:32:47 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Funeral> The PinePhone ships roughly twice a month, so with some unlucky timing it might not reach you in time

Sep 22 19:16:13 <Fq>	By the way, regarding the new devzone, I think it will be very useful to provide read-only access for the whole Pine64 community
Sep 22 19:17:10 <Fq>	This will keep everyone informed and will also make the whole community to feel as part of the process, including the non-developers
Sep 22 19:17:36 <Fq>	without interrupting the developers with (shipping/support?) questions
Sep 22 19:18:26 <Fq>	It will also help those who answer support questions by saying "devs are working on this or that".

Sep 22 19:44:23 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@gamiee> Not everything public, only parts which could be public
Sep 22 19:44:28 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@gamiee> Thanks üòÄ
Sep 22 19:44:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> that eeh, mostly will keep it down to nothing
Sep 22 19:44:53 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@caleb (they/them)> surely anything that would be public on devzone should be on the wiki instead
Sep 22 19:44:58 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> yes
Sep 22 19:45:00 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> exactly
Sep 22 19:56:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@gamiee> That's true
Sep 22 20:22:16 <Fq>	@PiZZaMartijn why is it not a good idea to have a ** read-only ** devzone publicly?
Sep 22 20:23:14 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> because stuff shows up there before it's announced
Sep 22 20:24:02 <Fq>	you mean potential new products that get discussed beforehand?
Sep 22 20:24:17 <Fq>	(and maybe dropped)
Sep 22 20:24:56 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> exactly
Sep 22 20:25:39 <Fq>	now, from my understanding devzone also has the purpose of developing for **current** products also. Is that not true?
Sep 22 20:26:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> yup
Sep 22 20:26:53 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> but that's mostly done in the public channels
Sep 22 20:27:20 <Fq>	So that is my main point, that all discussion and development about **current** products remains open.
Sep 22 20:28:08 <Fq>	Otherwise the community will end up divided into the "elite" class that has been accepted into the devzone, and the second-citizen class; 
Sep 22 20:28:19 <Fq>	the Linux kernel mailing lists are open to all for reading
Sep 22 20:28:20 <Alho>	but the whole idea of "some" of it is handled in closed devzone makes Pine64 a NOT opensorce software and hardware product anymore
Sep 22 20:28:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> ofcourse everything is as open as possible, but not everything can be public, which is why this needs to exist
Sep 22 20:29:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> it's not like all the open developments is going away üòõ
Sep 22 20:29:12 <Alho>	The devzone is really a misfoster - and a disaster from the beginning
Sep 22 20:29:15 <Fq>	I could see how new products that are not announced should be discussed beforehand, but I see no reason for current products
Sep 22 20:29:27 <Fq>	especially if the access is read-only
Sep 22 20:29:50 <Fq>	This is the kind of thing that tends to break communities
Sep 22 20:30:05 <Alho>	exactly
Sep 22 20:30:18 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> you seem to think that the things that are in devzone were public before
Sep 22 20:30:50 <Fq>	In other words, the devzone should be divided into two clear areas: 1) new possible products that will never be announced, and 2) discussion about existing products
Sep 22 20:31:10 <Fq>	What I am focusing on is that 2) be open read-only to the public
Sep 22 20:31:15 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@caleb (they/them)> there isn't much reason for development work for current devices to happen on devzone
Sep 22 20:31:31 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@caleb (they/them)> the wiki, public channels and mailing lists are far better platforms
Sep 22 20:31:46 <Alho>	but that will most likely happen as it is now
Sep 22 20:31:50 <Fq>	But @PiZZaMartijn said that some of the development for current products is happening there too
Sep 22 20:31:51 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@caleb (they/them)> i don't think there's any intention of devzone being used for active development of stuff that you can go buy
Sep 22 20:32:06 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> no the current projects are listed in the devzone
Sep 22 20:32:12 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> so far nothing has happened on them
Sep 22 20:32:32 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> devzone is also just neat to keep track of who has which devkits etc, this is not replacing all the open development
Sep 22 20:33:18 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@caleb (they/them)> there's obviously no benefit to gatekeeping development efforts, that would kinda defeat the purpose of pine64... to the best of my knowledge it's not something anyone ever planned as a usecase for it
Sep 22 20:33:28 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@caleb (they/them)> for the reasons you've stated - it would be dumb
Sep 22 20:34:42 <Fq>	one of the reasons stated for devzone is that it was hard to track development with everything mixed in different places, so different people seem to have different ideas about what devzone is
Sep 22 20:35:05 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> devzone is the bucket where all the small features are thrown in that are needed for organizing
Sep 22 20:35:38 <Fq>	small features of existing products?
Sep 22 20:36:05 <Fq>	but you just said there is no development there for existing products, only for potential products that may never be announced.
Sep 22 20:36:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> no, features for organizing. like developer lists, the signup stuff, timeline tracking
Sep 22 20:36:21 <Fq>	I see
Sep 22 20:36:33 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@caleb (they/them)> ie for the people who are being sent devices for the purposes of working on them
Sep 22 20:36:35 <Fq>	There is no reason for those features to be closed to the public
Sep 22 20:36:43 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> there definetly is
Sep 22 20:36:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> there are plenty of reasons
Sep 22 20:36:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> do you want to publicly list all the GDPR protected contact info of developers?
Sep 22 20:37:15 <Fq>	Ahh, i see
Sep 22 20:37:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> timeline might be public, but it's not exciting at all, and mostly used for tracking products that are not public yet
Sep 22 20:37:51 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> something something D1 SBC :>
Sep 22 20:38:05 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> although I'm still trying to figure out whether I want that
Sep 22 20:38:32 <Fq>	I think if it is clearly slated for potential products that may or may not be produced then it is okay
Sep 22 20:38:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> I'll probably get it just for the novelty of RISC-V that's not a softcore
Sep 22 20:39:18 <Fq>	but if it breaks the community of existing products then I think it needs to be done very carefuly
Sep 22 20:40:22 <Fq>	this has happened in open source projects in the past, in the beginning there was no problem, but with time things broke down.
Sep 22 20:40:34 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> that's not the intention ofcourse, and most of that development is already done split over the public chats here thanks to all the bridging that's done so devs on all platforms can talk together
Sep 22 20:40:47 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> and a lot of development just happens in distribution specific chat channels
Sep 22 20:41:17 <Fq>	yes, but many of those channels are visible to the public in some way 
Sep 22 20:41:43 <Fq>	this is why I was advocating read-only access for that kind of information (not for private information)
Sep 22 20:41:59 <Fq>	Just like it is done for linux kernel dev.
Sep 22 20:42:02 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> I'm not a -huge- fan of knowledge being gated behind devzone, but my understanding is that it is primarily for knowledge that can't be shared for legal or other reasons
Sep 22 20:42:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> if there is any info that _can_ be public, it _is_ public
Sep 22 20:42:27 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> the development talks you refer to already happen outside of devzone
Sep 22 20:43:17 <Fq>	@Philpax, I see; if it is maintained that way then it makes sense.
Sep 22 20:44:01 <Fq>	There are a few discussions about the linux kernel (like some intel hardware security bugs) that had to be discussed in private, but that is the very rare exception.
Sep 22 20:44:13 <Fq>	I would hope devzone would be like that.
Sep 22 20:45:12 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> mm, same
Sep 22 20:45:26 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> I guess we'll see, I'm hoping for the best
Sep 22 20:46:04 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> I'll be signing up for devzone once I get some working devices going and can do some dev
Sep 22 20:47:43 <Fq>	Yes, I really would hate to see such great progress be hampered by something that can be prevented early with a clear policy about making public what can be public, like @PiZZaMartijn says. It needs to be clearly established so that it doesn't come and byte the community in the future.
Sep 22 20:49:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> I think, if the decision to publicise something is made because of policy, that the battle has already been lost
Sep 22 20:49:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> This only really works if people want their work to be public
Sep 22 20:50:59 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> heh, who doesn't want credit
Sep 22 20:51:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> it's not like the developers are pine64 developers and they start working in-company now, the developers working on pine products usually do that because they like working in the open üôÇ
Sep 22 20:52:40 <Fq>	Yes, that is the case now, but with time it could break if you set up an environment that is not open; this is what I was warning about.
Sep 22 20:53:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@‚ô¶ –ëÃ∏ÃîÃà–∞Ã∂ÃãÃΩ—ÄÃ∂ÕêÕÇ–æÃµÃáÃü–ΩÃ∂ÃíÃê ‚ô¶> I want to apologize to the dev teams for the PR nightmare, and express my gratitude for the fact you didn't permaban me the moment I walked in here
Sep 22 20:54:56 <Fq>	Philpax, oh yes, I agree with you.
Sep 22 21:07:53 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Tenacious-Techhunter> So, what are the plans if ARM won‚Äôt license legitimate ARM cores to Rockchip anymore on account of the recent China shenanigans?

Sep 23 19:40:21 <Fq>	@fireTwoOneNine, may be a good time to delegate some of your work to someone you trust in the community; that way you won't burn out (since you said it is getting 'unwieldy to manage')
Sep 23 19:40:48 <dsimic>	fireTwoOneNine: no problem, thank you anyway
Sep 23 19:42:45 <Fq>	we all need to help each other and not burnout
Sep 23 19:44:35 <dsimic>	of course, but it's up to fire219 to decide about that
Sep 23 19:45:39 <xmn_>	fireTwoOneNine, so the irc only was causing issues or just wasn't used enough? Just curious.
Sep 23 19:46:19 <Fq>	ohh yes, for sure. Not intending to force anything, just from times in the past when I was about to burn out and I didn't notice myself, thought it might help

Sep 23 19:48:07 <Fq>	Someone mentioned to me that I could burn out if I kept doing what I was doing, I really had not noticed. I followed the advice of this friend and it really helped the people I was serving.
Sep 23 19:48:37 <dsimic>	too much of the good stuff is sometimes bad :)
Sep 23 19:48:46 <Fq>	hehehe yup
Sep 23 19:49:25 <dsimic>	but also delegating things can be tough, meaning that it can end up in even more work
Sep 23 19:49:42 <Fq>	yes, has to be someone you trust to be responsible
Sep 23 19:52:49 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@mite> would be cool to see a powerful arm64 workstation be developed
Sep 23 19:53:57 <Fq>	By the way, it would be good to keep an eye on what https://frame.work/ is doing with their DIY laptops, it has some very good ideas that Pine64 could use
Sep 23 19:54:21 <Fq>	(like pasting a sticker with a bar code on the replaceable parts)
Sep 23 19:55:24 <Fq>	here is a review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rkTgPt3M4k
Sep 23 19:55:43 <Fq>	s/bar code/qr code/
Sep 23 19:58:55 <Fq>	(or putting a little shutter window over the webcam lens)
Sep 23 20:00:28 <Fq>	If you watch the video you may want to skip until he actually shows the hardware, he talks a lot :)
Sep 23 20:05:36 <dsimic>	having QR code stickers on all parts is a nice idea, and Pine64 SBCs already come with some stickers with QR codes
Sep 23 20:06:05 <dsimic>	I haven't checked what's in those QR codes, though :)
Sep 23 20:08:24 <dsimic>	as a note, there's already a privacy switch for the webcam on the PBP, which cuts power to the webcam
Sep 23 20:08:33 <Fq>	one of the best things they did is the expansion slots, starting at 5min 15sec in the video
Sep 23 20:12:15 <dsimic>	let me watch the video...
Sep 23 20:15:01 <Fq>	ahh, I didn't know the SBCs came with QR codes with links to parts info and  how to replace them, great!
Sep 23 20:21:07 <dsimic>	quite frankly, I don't like those modular expansion slots, because the interface exposed by the motherbord is USB
Sep 23 20:21:26 <dsimic>	which means that none of those modules provides native ports
Sep 23 20:22:04 <dsimic>	for example, there isn't possible to have a native Ethernet port, which I think non-consumer laptops should have
Sep 23 20:24:48 <dsimic>	not to mention that those expansion slots and modules add to the cost :)
Sep 23 20:32:50 <dsimic>	if the Framework laptop fails to deliver motherboard upgrades down the road, the whole thing won't make much sense :)
Sep 23 20:34:10 <dsimic>	also, with those modules isn't possible to have a modular native microSD slot, which is essential on ARM systems

Sep 24 10:43:45 <dsimic>	I see laptopts as self-contained units
Sep 24 10:43:58 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> With m.2 E key you could absolutely solder wires to take the SDIO and UART connections for a wifi module elsewhere while still leaving the PCIe connection on the multiphy PCIe connection in place for an SSD in that slot
Sep 24 10:44:00 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> what would you do with a PCIe 4x inside the laptop, dsimic? the only thing I can really think of is storage or the LiteFury or something
Sep 24 10:44:02 <dsimic>	which should be as powerful as possible without the need to attache a whole bunch of stuff
Sep 24 10:44:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> (to be clear, I agree with you, I think having as much in the laptop is good, but I'm trying to figure out what you could actually add here)
Sep 24 10:44:42 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Thanos the tank engine> imagine the bottleneck factor of ann RTX 3090 connected to the rk3588 based pinebook pro pro
Sep 24 10:44:42 <dsimic>	I'd use PCIe for an SSD (or even two, for RAID 1) and WiFi card
Sep 24 10:44:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> And the beauty of it all is that if that big PCIe controller plays nice with GPUs and thunderbolt then there's literally no reason that idea couldn't work in theory
Sep 24 10:44:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> (nobody ships GPUs on NVMe, do they? :P)
Sep 24 10:45:01 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> M.2, bah, I keep mixing those up
Sep 24 10:45:17 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Thanos the tank engine> no, GPUs on M.2 are not a thing
Sep 24 10:45:27 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> There are framebuffer/blitter units that output over vga but that's it
Sep 24 10:45:32 <dsimic>	theer are some M.2 GPUs, but they are basic
Sep 24 10:45:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Thanos the tank engine> not exactly super useful
Sep 24 10:45:57 <dsimic>	right, just for a console
Sep 24 10:45:59 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> @Thanos the tank engine sometimes you just need to machine learn at a coffee shop and your RTX 3090
Sep 24 10:46:40 <dsimic>	oh, yeah :)
Sep 24 10:47:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> So yeah if I ever disappear for a few months after we get an RK3588 pinebook you can probably assume I've gone into some kind of "I will not go online until I finish this crazy project and make a blog post about it" thing lol
Sep 24 10:47:13 <dsimic>	lugging around external GPUs is fun, with their 350 W PSU bricks :)
Sep 24 10:47:33 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> dsimic: my home setup it a ThinkPad with an external RX 570
Sep 24 10:47:38 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> I will cheer you on Segfault o7
Sep 24 10:47:52 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Thanos the tank engine> >sets down Pinebook on table at coffee shop
Sep 24 10:47:53 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Thanos the tank engine> >pulls RTX 3090 eGPU out of bag and sets it on the floor, plugging it in to the nearest outlet
Sep 24 10:47:54 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Thanos the tank engine> >the lights dim for a second as the sheer power of your rig is too much for the building to handle
Sep 24 10:47:55 <dsimic>	but do you lug the GPU around, Segfault?
Sep 24 10:47:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Thanos the tank engine> >all the peasants are staring at you, jealous of your rig
Sep 24 10:48:07 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> I took it to a LAN party once
Sep 24 10:48:23 <dsimic>	once doesn't count :)
Sep 24 10:48:34 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> you have a decent laptop that becomes a workstation when you're at home, and you can bring your workstation with you if you really need to
Sep 24 10:49:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Thanos the tank engine> >you start training an AI on it, the heat output raising the temperature of the building noticeably
Sep 24 10:49:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Thanos the tank engine> >people start leaving, throwing dirty looks at you
Sep 24 10:49:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Thanos the tank engine> >they're still just jealous
Sep 24 10:49:29 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> I was tempted by the Flow X13 which takes this concept to the extreme (small ultrabook-ish device with a 3080 eGPU), but it was ungodly expensive
Sep 24 10:49:49 <dsimic>	let me express my thoughts again: laptops should be as powerful as possible as self-contained units, and having powerful expansion ports on them is perfectly fine if that doesn't collide with the previous objective
Sep 24 10:50:13 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> dsimic: then clearly you're not the target market for an egpu :P
Sep 24 10:50:29 <dsimic>	that's correct
Sep 24 10:50:30 *	inky has quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
Sep 24 10:50:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> oh, I agree: but that's what I mean, you can't really extend the laptop internally in a way that will make it substantially more powerful
Sep 24 10:50:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> WiFi can be engineered into the device in this hypothetical future
Sep 24 10:50:59 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Thanosthetankengine> the entire point of egpus and things like convergence on phones is just having one device
Sep 24 10:51:26 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> My pinebook already has the best SSD I own lol
Sep 24 10:51:27 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> RAID on a laptop is a possible outcome, but again, probably not the target market for a PBU
Sep 24 10:51:38 <dsimic>	yeah, but making the laptop weak so an eGPU could be connected makes little sense
Sep 24 10:51:58 <dsimic>	I'd love to have RAID 1, for example -- not everyone whats the same :)
Sep 24 10:52:02 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> you're not making it weaker though, imo! :p
Sep 24 10:52:03 <dsimic>	wants *
Sep 24 10:52:21 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> I don't see much point in RAID unless you've already got like 4-6 drives lol
Sep 24 10:52:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> true, but my opinion is the number of use cases enabled by external connectivity outweighs that of internal connectivity
Sep 24 10:52:31 <dsimic>	yeah, but putting PCIe x4 onto the TB port would leave not much
Sep 24 10:52:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> It's just not cost effective otherwise
Sep 24 10:52:53 <dsimic>	RAID 1 for data safety and better read performance
Sep 24 10:53:10 <dsimic>	keeping my data safe is priceless :)
Sep 24 10:53:24 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> dsimic: in theory at least, connecting the SSD to a multiphy would only lose you 50mb/s at most, at least on slower drives like the 660p which I already think is plenty fast enough
Sep 24 10:53:58 <dsimic>	660p turns into ~120 MB/s writes once the cache is exhausted
Sep 24 10:54:03 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> The biggest hit would actually be wifi because you'd be stuck with SDIO modules rather than PCIe
Sep 24 10:54:23 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> I'm not exhausting the cache lol
Sep 24 10:54:40 <dsimic>	see, I don't use WiFi at all, but I still care about other people getting good WiFI performance :)
Sep 24 10:55:08 <dsimic>	I would've exhausted the 660p cache many times :)
Sep 24 10:55:15 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Thanos the tank engine> so yeah there's a tradeoff
Sep 24 10:55:32 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Absolutely, but I also don't particularly care about wifi performance as long as it's faster than my internet connection so in this theoretical world I don't care about the small performance loss from a setup like that
Sep 24 10:55:47 <dsimic>	but I still think that getting good SSD performance and good WiFi performance is much more important than connecting an eGPU :)
Sep 24 10:55:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Even the PBPs current WiFi module is adequate for me
Sep 24 10:56:20 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> So yes in this theoretical world I don't actually lose any significant SSD or wifi performance
Sep 24 10:56:20 <dsimic>	not all peopla use WiFi to access the Internet only
Sep 24 10:56:24 <dsimic>	people *
Sep 24 10:56:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Thanos the tank engine> splitting t5he 4 lanes from the pcie3.0 into 2 sets of 2 lanes could be fun for putting 2 SSDs in RAID
Sep 24 10:56:39 <dsimic>	many people have local NASes, for example
Sep 24 10:56:43 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> If the controller supports it
Sep 24 10:56:53 <dsimic>	yes, if supported
Sep 24 10:57:04 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> only four lanes is pretty limiting though :(
Sep 24 10:57:14 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Four lanes is quite a bit at 3.0 speeds
Sep 24 10:57:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> 32gbit/s
Sep 24 10:57:31 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Thanos the tank engine> two drives in a raid1 could be faster than one drive with the full bandwidth
Sep 24 10:57:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I'd be surprised if the interconnect rockchip designs will be able to handle that much tbh
Sep 24 10:57:51 <dsimic>	RAID 1 allows faster reads
Sep 24 10:58:15 <dsimic>	right, the RK3588 probably wouldn't be able to handle all that :)
Sep 24 10:58:20 <dsimic>	but the PCHs are no better
Sep 24 10:58:29 <dsimic>	they also cannot handle all that's connected to them
Sep 24 10:58:32 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Thanos the tank engine> in a raid0 you'd get fdaster everything but no redundancy
Sep 24 10:58:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Thanos the tank engine> raid1 would have the redundancy benefits at least
Sep 24 10:58:58 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> We can only hope rockchip sees this as an opportunity to create a future proof design (like with the 32gb ram limit) so they iron out the bottlenecks before they can become a problem in the next generation
Sep 24 10:59:14 <dsimic>	NVMe SSDa are already fast, but I'd like to have redundancy
Sep 24 10:59:19 <dsimic>	* SSDs
Sep 24 10:59:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> can a PCIE 3.0 lane be bifurcated into two PCIE 2.0 lanes?
Sep 24 10:59:47 <dsimic>	right, let's hope that the RK3588 will be really done right :)
Sep 24 10:59:59 <dsimic>	that depends on the controller
Sep 24 11:00:06 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> It wouldn't be 2.0 lanes
Sep 24 11:00:06 <dsimic>	^^^ Philpax
Sep 24 11:00:19 <dsimic>	2 x x2 3.0 lanes
Sep 24 11:00:26 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> If it can it would be splitting it into two 3.0 2x lanes yeah
Sep 24 11:00:35 <dsimic>	x2, not 2x :)
Sep 24 11:00:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Or possibly even something like one 3.0 1x and one 3.0 3x
Sep 24 11:00:53 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> iirc there's technically nothing stopping PCIe from working with odd numbers of lanes
Sep 24 11:01:07 <dsimic>	I'm not aware of such layouts
Sep 24 11:01:25 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Non standard of course
Sep 24 11:01:34 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> But theoretically I think they can work
Sep 24 11:01:46 <dsimic>	even having 4 x x1 would be nice :)
Sep 24 11:01:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I'm pretty sure there's also at least one 32x implementation
Sep 24 11:02:12 <dsimic>	I've seen some x24 slots, IIRC
Sep 24 11:02:24 <dsimic>	again, x2, not 2x, for example :)
Sep 24 11:02:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Bah that's semantics :P
Sep 24 11:03:06 <dsimic>	well, we should strive to correctness :)
Sep 24 11:03:18 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> ah right, I thought 3.0 was double 2.0 but that's only true of 4.0 and above
Sep 24 11:03:28 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> No 3.0 is double 2.0
Sep 24 11:03:31 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Just as 2.0 is double 1.0
Sep 24 11:03:44 <dsimic>	bifurcation can't change the generation
Sep 24 11:03:45 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> negatory, 2.0 is 5 GT/s, 3.0 is 8 GT/s
Sep 24 11:03:54 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Almost double :P
Sep 24 11:04:18 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> iirc the real world numbers for 2.0 are actually 4gt/s
Sep 24 11:04:36 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> yeah, I was just wondering if it was possible to reconfigure a PCI-E 3.0 port with 4 lanes into a PCI-E 2.0 port with 8 lanes essentially
Sep 24 11:04:38 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> And for 3.0 they're like 7.8gt/s or something
Sep 24 11:04:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Yeah no
Sep 24 11:04:47 <dsimic>	nope, bifurcation can't change the generation
Sep 24 11:04:53 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> yep, that's what I thought
Sep 24 11:04:58 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> ah well :-)
Sep 24 11:05:05 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Part of how 3.0 got extra speed was reducing error correction btw
Sep 24 11:05:10 <dsimic>	we can't have it all :)
Sep 24 11:05:17 <dsimic>	different encoding
Sep 24 11:05:27 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Those 5/8 numbers are theoretical numbers before encoding yeah
Sep 24 11:05:47 <dsimic>	IIRC, those are numbers after deducing the encoding overhead
Sep 24 11:06:02 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I'm fairly certain it's before
Sep 24 11:06:13 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Because PCIe 2.0 x1 is 500MB/s real world
Sep 24 11:06:24 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Which is 4GT/s
Sep 24 11:06:26 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Not 5
Sep 24 11:07:21 <dsimic>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express#History_and_revisions
Sep 24 11:07:37 <dsimic>	"Throughput indicates the unencoded bandwidth (without 8b/10b or 128b/130b encoding overhead)."
Sep 24 11:07:56 <dsimic>	see, I wrote chunks of the PCI Express article :)
Sep 24 11:08:33 <dsimic>	but you're right
Sep 24 11:08:47 <dsimic>	those are the numbers that don't take the overhead into account
Sep 24 11:08:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Oh weird
Sep 24 11:09:32 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> well, we're dreaming - take the Framework approach and turn the PCI-E interface into a modular component that you can switch out to a M.2 port or a Thunderbolt port as you wish :P
Sep 24 11:11:26 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Oh also talking about thunderbolt again, I've got more uses for it than just egpus so for someone like me a TB mod for the pbp could actually be insanely useful
Sep 24 11:11:26 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Note how I say mod, because for 99% of people it wouldn't make sense, I just happen to be the 1% of people crazy enough that something like that might just work :P
Sep 24 11:12:20 <dsimic>	better said, the GT/s numbers refer to the encoded data (including the overhead), while the GB/s numbers refer to the payload (exlcuding the overhead)
Sep 24 11:12:48 <dsimic>	"Transfer rate is expressed in transfers per second instead of bits per second because the number of transfers includes the overhead bits, which do not provide additional throughput;[48] PCIe 1.x uses an 8b/10b encoding scheme, resulting in a 20% (= 2/10) overhead on the raw channel bandwidth.[49] So in the PCIe terminology, transfer rate refers to the encoded bit rate: 2.5 GT/s is 2.5 Gbps on the encoded 
Sep 24 11:12:54 <dsimic>	serial link. This corresponds to 2.0 Gbps of pre-coded data or 250 MB/s, which is referred to as throughput in PCIe."
Sep 24 11:13:52 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> @Segfault I'll take the bait, what do you use TB for?
Sep 24 11:14:05 <dsimic>	eGPU
Sep 24 11:14:22 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Well, GPUs, high speed networking and storage, and other small things that involve PCIe
Sep 24 11:14:23 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> they mentioned other uses
Sep 24 11:15:03 <dsimic>	I'd fully support having a TB port if we had enough PCIe lanes
Sep 24 11:15:22 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Oh the experiments I could run if I could plug a box into my PBP with a PCIe slot in it
Sep 24 11:15:46 <dsimic>	get a RockPro64 and enjoy :)
Sep 24 11:16:16 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I've got the box :)

Sep 24 11:17:46 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> what's the 3x PCIe 2.0 used for if you don't use the SATA port?
Sep 24 11:18:03 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> On the RK3588?
Sep 24 11:18:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> yup
Sep 24 11:18:18 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I think only two of the multiphys will have PCIe
Sep 24 11:18:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> So it's actually 2x PCIe 2.0 x1 I'm pretty sure
Sep 24 11:18:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Theoretically one would be used for an m.2 E key slot so you can use a pcie wifi module
Sep 24 11:19:10 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> The other one... beats me...
Sep 24 11:19:16 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
Sep 24 11:19:25 <dsimic>	hmm, "3x PCIe 2.0" should mean "3 x x1 PCIe 2.0" or "x2 PCIe 2.0 and x1 PCIe 2.0"
Sep 24 11:19:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> That 3x PCIe 2.0 comes from a cnx article which I'm pretty sure is riddled with errors
Sep 24 11:20:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I think they mistook 3 multiphys as 3 PCIe 2.0 controllers
Sep 24 11:20:42 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I'd imagine the rk3588 will probably have a multiphy layout similar to the RK3568
Sep 24 11:21:02 <dsimic>	it's most probably just x1 PCIe 2.0 muxed with a SATA port
Sep 24 11:21:34 <dsimic>	because there's only one SATA port
Sep 24 11:21:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> At least one of the controllers should be configured the same way it is on the quartz, so SATA/PCIe
Sep 24 11:21:56 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> And I think one will be configured for USB 3.0/SATA
Sep 24 11:22:05 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> But I'm not sure on that
Sep 24 11:22:16 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> And I don't know what the 3rd one is configured as
Sep 24 11:22:20 <dsimic>	with that in mind, it's most probably only x1 PCIe 2.0
Sep 24 11:22:24 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Again, check the RK3568 specs
Sep 24 11:22:50 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Nono I think it's 2 separate pcie 2.0 x1 links assuming all multiphys that can be used for PCIe are

Sep 24 11:23:29 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> I believe that says, exactly, "three lanes PCI-e 2.0/SATA 3.0"
Sep 24 11:23:32 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> make of that what you will
Sep 24 11:24:14 <dsimic>	RK3568: SATA 3.0 x3, PCIE 2.1(1x1Lane), Combo with 3 Serdes Lanes, PCIE3.0 1 √ó2 Lanes/2 √ó1 Lane @ 8Gbps

Sep 24 11:25:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> also while researching this, I saw this, and that seems like tough pricing to make
Sep 24 11:25:31 <dsimic>	if that's to be believed, there can be two PCIe 3.0 x1 root ports, or one PCIe 3.0 x2 root port
Sep 24 11:25:31 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/463285150898192384/890997380881711154/unknown.png
Sep 24 11:25:33 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> time will tell I suppose
Sep 24 11:26:37 <dsimic>	so, there will be support for bifurcation :)
Sep 24 11:26:39 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Maybe see if they had a similar slide for the RK3568? Since that's actually been released we could compare what they said to what we got
Sep 24 11:26:55 <dsimic>	good point
Sep 24 11:28:11 <dsimic>	https://www.96rocks.com/img/blog/introduce-rk3568/rk3568_block_diagram.png
Sep 24 11:28:46 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Ignore the pcie 3.0 controller in that diagram btw, that's specific to the RK3568, sort of like the 3.0 x4 controller in the 3588
Sep 24 11:28:54 <dsimic>	according to that RK3568 block diagram, PCIe 3.0 x2 supports bifurcation into 2 x x1
Sep 24 11:29:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> yep I think that image is from the same conference (Rockchip DC 2020)
Sep 24 11:29:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> it's September 2021, where did the time go? :-)
Sep 24 11:29:21 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> That sounds hopeful for the 3588 3.0 controller doing the same then
Sep 24 11:29:55 <dsimic>	there's a total of three serdes/PHYs for USB 3.0, SATA and PCIe 2.0
Sep 24 11:30:36 <dsimic>	so it should be possible to have one more PCIe 2.0 x1 and two USB 3.0 ports, for example
Sep 24 11:30:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/463285150898192384/890998679845085244/unknown.jpeg
Sep 24 11:30:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> That's the 3568
Sep 24 11:30:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Those muxes are the multiphys
Sep 24 11:31:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I would imagine the 3588 will be laid out the same way

Sep 24 11:31:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Although maybe not because that only has a single pcie 2.0 controller
Sep 24 11:31:54 <dsimic>	having one more PCIe 2.0 x1 and two USB 3.0 ports would be a nice choice for a laptop
Sep 24 11:32:13 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Maybe mux0 on the rk3588 will also have another pcie2.0 controller or something
Sep 24 11:32:21 <dsimic>	the more, the better :)
Sep 24 11:32:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> And iirc compared to that image the 3566 deleted the qsgmii controller and mux0
Sep 24 11:32:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> As well as the PCIe 3.0 contriller
Sep 24 11:33:40 <dsimic>	RK35666 support only one GE interface, so it makes sense
Sep 24 11:33:51 <dsimic>	* RK3566
Sep 24 11:33:56 <dsimic>	* supports
Sep 24 11:34:23 <dsimic>	hmm, GE interfaces are listed separately
Sep 24 11:34:37 <dsimic>	does that mean that RK3568 can have a total of six GE interfaces?

Sep 24 11:43:28 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I think it can do at least three although idk how qsgmii works
Sep 24 11:43:39 <dsimic>	according to the datasheet, the answer should be "yes"
Sep 24 11:44:14 <dsimic>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media-independent_interface#Quad_serial_gigabit_media-independent_interface
Sep 24 11:44:51 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Oh I see
Sep 24 11:44:54 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Interesting
Sep 24 11:45:00 <dsimic>	yes
Sep 24 11:45:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> So yeah I guess the RK3568 can run 6 Ethernet ports directly with the right hardware
Sep 24 11:45:22 <dsimic>	though, using an external switch ASIC, as the Banana RK3566 Router :) does, is a better option
Sep 24 11:45:38 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Why not both :P
Sep 24 11:45:47 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Wouldn't qsgmii give you better performance?
Sep 24 11:46:02 <dsimic>	the RK3568 cannot process the packets at wire speed as a switch ASIC can
Sep 24 11:46:04 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Because you've got a direct link to every port
Sep 24 11:46:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Does increasing packet size markedly decrease CPU use?
Sep 24 11:47:25 <dsimic>	it depends on the way network interface does its job, but in general, it should
Sep 24 11:47:49 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I wonder if the CPU would be powerful enough to route the theoretical what 12gbit/s of 9000mtu packets you could do with that many Ethernet ports lol
Sep 24 11:47:55 <dsimic>	in this case, it would be frame size :)
Sep 24 11:48:12 <dsimic>	I don't think so :)
Sep 24 11:48:25 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> That is a **lot** of packets lol
Sep 24 11:48:44 <dsimic>	that's why a better option is to use an external switch ASIC
Sep 24 11:48:54 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Although for applications where maximum performance isn't needed it might be a good idea anyway because it gives you better firewalling ability and such
Sep 24 11:49:19 <dsimic>	though, it would be interesting to keep the main two Ethernet ports separate, and connect two additional ports to the switch ASIC, in a bonded fashion :)
Sep 24 11:50:27 <dsimic>	those two main ports should be good enough to saturate the capabilities of the RK3568 as a firewall :)
Sep 24 11:50:39 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> It's crazy how Rockchip finds new ways to make their chips so versatile lol
Sep 24 11:50:50 <dsimic>	it's nice
Sep 24 11:51:00 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I mean the RK3568 could do so many things, it could be a high end router one minute and a NAS the next
Sep 24 11:51:17 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Or even a phone! :P
Sep 24 11:51:26 <dsimic>	I'm already working on interfacing with a couple of switch ASICs :)
Sep 24 11:52:04 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I mean hell this generation they were like "hmm this chip doesn't do enough stuff, let's just let it *modify itself on the fly*" with muxes :P

PinePhone Support told me to Flash OS to eMMC myself...attempted booting from Flashed microSD card, that didn't work. Then tried using JumpDrive, that didn't work. When plugged in, RED light turns on in top left of screen, screen barely lights up, then everything shuts down. Any assistance is greatly appreciated. Thanks

Sep 28 00:27:03 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> Yeah, but new folks will ask specific product questions here anyway. That is something to life with, IMO.
Sep 28 00:27:48 <dsimic>	quite frankly, I think that nobody reads those topics :)
Sep 28 00:28:17 <dsimic>	it's just that many new people probably "default" to the #pine64 channel :)
Sep 28 00:30:42 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> Its also laziness. Ask in the first channel you can find. Same like people asking things you have to look up yourself just to get the link, what the asking persons could have done themselves.

Sep 28 14:35:10 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <errquilibria> Yeah it picked the llvm automatically (re @p64protocolbot: [D] <gamiee> uuuuh llvmpipe)
Sep 28 14:35:54 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <errquilibria> How does Lima differ from llvm

Sep 28 14:36:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <Strit> So llvm will use the CPU instead of the GPU.
Sep 28 14:38:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <errquilibria> Oh OK, I'll look into that, wayland is a kernel driver though but I'll see if there is Lima support on this mali-400 etc hardware (re @p64protocolbot: [M] <Strit> Lima is a hardware driver, where llvm is a software driver I believe.)
Sep 28 14:39:16 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <Strit> You can check in your kernel with `zgrep LIMA /proc/config.gz`.
Sep 28 14:39:25 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <errquilibria> Ah yes, I understand, interesting stuff (re @p64protocolbot: [M] <Strit> So llvm will use the CPU instead of the GPU.)
Sep 28 14:40:39 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <errquilibria> I'll have a look yes thx for the info, it's bit late by me, almost 10 pm so will see tomorrow (re @p64protocolbot: [M] <Strit> You can check in your kernel with `zgrep LIMA /proc/config.gz`.)

Sep 30 04:09:41 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Krissy Silveropossum> I'd recommend editing the user agent in `about:config`
Sep 30 04:09:41 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Krissy Silveropossum> 
Sep 30 04:09:42 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Krissy Silveropossum> Leave everything the same, but *specifically* replace "Android" with "Linux"
Sep 30 04:09:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Krissy Silveropossum> 
Sep 30 04:09:45 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Krissy Silveropossum> Many websites will stop trying to harass you about android apps but will still present their mobile UIs
Sep 30 04:11:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> Better install an user agent switcher add-on. Sites detect the presence of a mobile phone in different ways, changing the user agent back to desktop will break a large amount of sites.
Sep 30 04:12:10 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Krissy Silveropossum> This does not change the user agent to desktop
Sep 30 04:12:39 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Krissy Silveropossum> The user agent string in this case still contains the word "Mobile", which appears to be what any site I've encountered thus far is relying on
Sep 30 04:12:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Krissy Silveropossum> if not the dimensions of screen, etc.

Sep 30 04:16:31 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <yerbkhan> me and my buddy want to order 2 devices, but there is 1 device limit per order, is it possible to make it 2 cuz we are 2 persons? order is in EU

Sep 30 04:17:04 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Cyastis> have you tried..
Sep 30 04:17:04 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Cyastis> 
Sep 30 04:17:06 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Cyastis> changing privacy.resistFingerprinting to True?
Sep 30 04:17:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Cyastis> Because that'll make the userAgent show Windows NT
Sep 30 04:17:59 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Cyastis> yerbkhan I think you'd have to order them separately unfortunately
Sep 30 04:18:23 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Cyastis> it's a carrier limit, not an arbitrary limit pine64 makes
Sep 30 04:20:45 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <thanos the they/them engine> yeah it's an issue of what they can send in the package, noy who orders it
Sep 30 04:21:49 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> To be fair, for the EU warehouse that doesn't apply, they are holding a stock there. But Pine probably can't or won't make the order process region-specific
Sep 30 04:21:50 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <thanos the they/them engine> wait that actually works? I'd have assumed that they were just using the fact that it's a mobile layout to decide to shill the app
Sep 30 04:22:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Krissy Silveropossum> Based on my experience, they're just looking for the word "Android" in the user a gent
Sep 30 04:22:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Krissy Silveropossum> Based on my experience, they're just looking for the word "Android" in the user agent
Sep 30 04:23:13 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <thanos the they/them engine> huh
Sep 30 04:23:18 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Krissy Silveropossum> Nothing is more annoying than reddit trying to thrust it's app upon me, imo XD
Sep 30 04:23:25 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Krissy Silveropossum> Nothing is more annoying than reddit trying to thrust its app upon me, imo XD
Sep 30 04:23:31 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <thanos the they/them engine> might not be a bad idea to put this in a PR
Sep 30 04:24:23 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Krissy Silveropossum> I think that'd be a better default user agent personally
Sep 30 04:24:28 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Krissy Silveropossum> also more technically accurate X3
Sep 30 04:25:01 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <thanos the they/them engine> if ti stops the app shilling then it already significantly improves the experience
