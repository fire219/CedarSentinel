Sep 22 00:51:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@mbohun> Is there actually a plan for a Pine64 "car dash-cam recording system" ?
Sep 22 00:51:58 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@mbohun> - modular/extensible
Sep 22 00:52:00 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@mbohun> - i would really love to build one with night vision / heat sensor for wildlife detection/avoidance (kangaroos, deer, wombats, echidnas, foxes, etc. EVERYWHERE! )
Sep 22 00:53:25 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@mbohun> yes, that is what i meant, pine64 seems to have all the different parts
Sep 22 00:53:33 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@mbohun> already

Sep 22 02:44:28 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@gamelaster (gamiee)> it should be possible with to do with Allwinner S3 which is currently used in PineCube

Sep 22 11:14:47 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@Strit> 
Sep 22 11:14:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@Strit> I don't think so. Because of some customs law.
Sep 22 11:15:38 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@arch frajer sa frizurom> are you going to fer, too, perchance?
Sep 22 11:26:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Funeral> Rahulraj: nah, they don't ship to India

Sep 22 12:29:17 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <@L> That's my last alternative
Sep 22 12:29:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <@L> I don't know if was shipped or not
Sep 22 12:29:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> You get two emails, one with an order confirmation and one later on with a tracking number
Sep 22 12:30:07 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> If you haven't received the second email then it hasn't shipped yet
Sep 22 12:52:14 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@jurapura13> @arch frajer sa frizurom I'm not going to FER, I'm going to a different city but virtually the same course

Sep 22 17:15:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> Hi guys!!
Sep 22 17:15:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> i have a question about shipping
Sep 22 17:15:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Funeral> Spit it out
Sep 22 17:16:24 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> if i ordered one pinephone and 2x pinetime, How can I find out when it will be at my address?
Sep 22 17:16:46 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> date field on site not working
Sep 22 17:17:03 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Funeral> You could order the PinePhone only individually, without the pinetime. For both orders you will get a mail with the tracking number once it ships
Sep 22 17:17:10 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Funeral> Which date field?
Sep 22 17:17:39 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Funeral> Or are you asking how long it would roughly take?
Sep 22 17:17:51 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> I have a flight on the 9th of next month it has to catch up
Sep 22 17:18:15 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> we can say from today until october 8
Sep 22 17:18:21 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Funeral> They ship from China and the PinePhone is usually a pre-order depending on your location
Sep 22 17:18:51 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> i'm in pennsylvania
Sep 22 17:19:12 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Funeral> Then it also depends on the shipping method, courier or slow shipping üòõ
Sep 22 17:20:01 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> May I know roughly how long it takes in America?
Sep 22 17:27:10 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Funeral> Nah, that's not possible
Sep 22 17:27:16 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Funeral> 3 to 40 days
Sep 22 17:28:45 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Funeral> Like said, it's a pre-order, there are different shipping methods
Sep 22 17:28:46 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> OMG
Sep 22 17:28:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> thanks man!
Sep 22 17:29:00 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> thats bad for me :(
Sep 22 17:29:17 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> i want to get pinephone but i will leave from USA
Sep 22 17:29:26 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> and you are not shipping Turkey yet
Sep 22 17:30:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Funeral> Well, did you order courier or standard and when?
Sep 22 17:31:21 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> I haven't done it yet, I'm looking for the fastest way
Sep 22 17:31:51 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Funeral> courier is fast but it's a pre-order üòÑ
Sep 22 17:32:47 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Funeral> The PinePhone ships roughly twice a month, so with some unlucky timing it might not reach you in time
Sep 22 18:36:51 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@GCJohnsonChevalier> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/463285150898192384/890381157961723934/2021-09-22-163552.webm
Sep 22 18:37:25 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@GCJohnsonChevalier> @fireTwoOneNine custom GPU on the PinePhone64 System on a Chip ?
Sep 22 18:40:16 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@fireTwoOneNine> the GPU on the pinephone is built into the same chip as the CPU
Sep 22 19:28:12 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@gamiee> @PiZZaMartijn i guess this is good idea
Sep 22 19:33:49 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@notLillie> I want more boards
Sep 22 19:34:12 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@notLillie> what would you all buy? üòõ
Sep 22 19:34:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@notLillie> I don‚Äôt have any pine64 SBCs, excluding the pinetime, and pinebook pro
Sep 22 19:36:50 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@notLillie> These two I won‚Äôt buy (quartz maybe later)
Sep 22 19:36:51 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@notLillie> Quartz64: No, waiting for that one to mature. (Mostly because of the USB issue.)
Sep 22 19:36:52 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@notLillie> Pine A64: far too slow.
Sep 22 19:38:58 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@notLillie> I guess that leaves the rockpro64. Rock64 is starting to show its age anyways‚Ä¶ üòõ
Sep 22 19:43:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@caleb (they/them)> @GAMELASTER i like your banner !
Sep 22 19:43:31 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> @GAMELASTER having devzone be public is not a good idea
Sep 22 19:44:23 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@gamiee> Not everything public, only parts which could be public
Sep 22 19:44:28 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@gamiee> Thanks üòÄ
Sep 22 19:44:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> that eeh, mostly will keep it down to nothing
Sep 22 19:44:53 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@caleb (they/them)> surely anything that would be public on devzone should be on the wiki instead
Sep 22 19:44:58 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> yes
Sep 22 19:45:00 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> exactly
Sep 22 19:56:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@gamiee> That's true
Sep 22 20:23:14 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> because stuff shows up there before it's announced
Sep 22 20:24:56 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> exactly
Sep 22 20:26:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> yup
Sep 22 20:26:53 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> but that's mostly done in the public channels
Sep 22 20:28:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> ofcourse everything is as open as possible, but not everything can be public, which is why this needs to exist
Sep 22 20:29:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> it's not like all the open developments is going away üòõ
Sep 22 20:30:18 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> you seem to think that the things that are in devzone were public before
Sep 22 20:31:15 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@caleb (they/them)> there isn't much reason for development work for current devices to happen on devzone
Sep 22 20:31:31 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@caleb (they/them)> the wiki, public channels and mailing lists are far better platforms
Sep 22 20:31:51 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@caleb (they/them)> i don't think there's any intention of devzone being used for active development of stuff that you can go buy
Sep 22 20:32:06 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> no the current projects are listed in the devzone
Sep 22 20:32:12 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> so far nothing has happened on them
Sep 22 20:32:32 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> devzone is also just neat to keep track of who has which devkits etc, this is not replacing all the open development
Sep 22 20:33:18 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@caleb (they/them)> there's obviously no benefit to gatekeeping development efforts, that would kinda defeat the purpose of pine64... to the best of my knowledge it's not something anyone ever planned as a usecase for it
Sep 22 20:33:28 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@caleb (they/them)> for the reasons you've stated - it would be dumb
Sep 22 20:35:05 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> devzone is the bucket where all the small features are thrown in that are needed for organizing
Sep 22 20:36:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> no, features for organizing. like developer lists, the signup stuff, timeline tracking
Sep 22 20:36:33 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@caleb (they/them)> ie for the people who are being sent devices for the purposes of working on them
Sep 22 20:36:43 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> there definetly is
Sep 22 20:36:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> there are plenty of reasons
Sep 22 20:36:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> do you want to publicly list all the GDPR protected contact info of developers?
Sep 22 20:37:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> timeline might be public, but it's not exciting at all, and mostly used for tracking products that are not public yet
Sep 22 20:37:51 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> something something D1 SBC :>
Sep 22 20:38:05 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> although I'm still trying to figure out whether I want that
Sep 22 20:38:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> I'll probably get it just for the novelty of RISC-V that's not a softcore
Sep 22 20:40:34 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> that's not the intention ofcourse, and most of that development is already done split over the public chats here thanks to all the bridging that's done so devs on all platforms can talk together
Sep 22 20:40:47 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> and a lot of development just happens in distribution specific chat channels
Sep 22 20:42:02 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> I'm not a -huge- fan of knowledge being gated behind devzone, but my understanding is that it is primarily for knowledge that can't be shared for legal or other reasons
Sep 22 20:42:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> if there is any info that _can_ be public, it _is_ public
Sep 22 20:42:27 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> the development talks you refer to already happen outside of devzone
Sep 22 20:45:12 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> mm, same
Sep 22 20:45:26 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> I guess we'll see, I'm hoping for the best
Sep 22 20:46:04 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> I'll be signing up for devzone once I get some working devices going and can do some dev
Sep 22 20:49:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> I think, if the decision to publicise something is made because of policy, that the battle has already been lost
Sep 22 20:49:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> This only really works if people want their work to be public
Sep 22 20:50:59 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> heh, who doesn't want credit
Sep 22 20:51:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> it's not like the developers are pine64 developers and they start working in-company now, the developers working on pine products usually do that because they like working in the open üôÇ

Sep 23 23:52:04 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Cyastis> dsimic: you can have a minimum 1Gbps ethernet connection from usb c so I assume it will cone with time
Sep 23 23:53:36 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Cyastis> dsimic: you can have a minimum 1Gbps ethernet connection from usb c so I assume it will come with time
Sep 23 23:53:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Cyastis> 
Sep 23 23:53:38 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Cyastis> ~~also it'd probably be 10x cheaper to get adapters sadly~~
Sep 24 00:38:05 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Ocawesome101> dsimic: they support thunderbolt 4 iirc
Sep 24 01:39:50 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@arch frajer sa frizurom> i thought bpfilter is abandoned?
Sep 24 02:30:29 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <@P. Salvatore> Buongiorno. Sono interessato all'acquisto del Pinenote, sono residente in Italia, ma sul sito www.pine64.org/pinenote/ non si puo' accedere alla procedura di acqisto. C'√® una alternativa? Grazie
Sep 24 02:32:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> Hey we try to keep discussion here in English, it's easier to moderate that way and you're more likely to get a response
Sep 24 02:32:56 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> As for the question, the pinenote isn't available for purchase yet as far as I can tell, it'll be available soon as a development unit though
Sep 24 10:43:58 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> With m.2 E key you could absolutely solder wires to take the SDIO and UART connections for a wifi module elsewhere while still leaving the PCIe connection on the multiphy PCIe connection in place for an SSD in that slot
Sep 24 10:44:00 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> what would you do with a PCIe 4x inside the laptop, dsimic? the only thing I can really think of is storage or the LiteFury or something
Sep 24 10:44:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> (to be clear, I agree with you, I think having as much in the laptop is good, but I'm trying to figure out what you could actually add here)
Sep 24 10:44:42 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Thanos the tank engine> imagine the bottleneck factor of ann RTX 3090 connected to the rk3588 based pinebook pro pro
Sep 24 10:44:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> And the beauty of it all is that if that big PCIe controller plays nice with GPUs and thunderbolt then there's literally no reason that idea couldn't work in theory
Sep 24 10:44:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> (nobody ships GPUs on NVMe, do they? :P)
Sep 24 10:45:01 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> M.2, bah, I keep mixing those up
Sep 24 10:45:17 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Thanos the tank engine> no, GPUs on M.2 are not a thing
Sep 24 10:45:27 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> There are framebuffer/blitter units that output over vga but that's it
Sep 24 10:45:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Thanos the tank engine> not exactly super useful
Sep 24 10:45:59 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> @Thanos the tank engine sometimes you just need to machine learn at a coffee shop and your RTX 3090
Sep 24 10:47:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> So yeah if I ever disappear for a few months after we get an RK3588 pinebook you can probably assume I've gone into some kind of "I will not go online until I finish this crazy project and make a blog post about it" thing lol
Sep 24 10:47:33 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> dsimic: my home setup it a ThinkPad with an external RX 570
Sep 24 10:47:38 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> I will cheer you on Segfault o7
Sep 24 10:47:52 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Thanos the tank engine> >sets down Pinebook on table at coffee shop
Sep 24 10:47:53 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Thanos the tank engine> >pulls RTX 3090 eGPU out of bag and sets it on the floor, plugging it in to the nearest outlet
Sep 24 10:47:54 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Thanos the tank engine> >the lights dim for a second as the sheer power of your rig is too much for the building to handle
Sep 24 10:47:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Thanos the tank engine> >all the peasants are staring at you, jealous of your rig
Sep 24 10:48:07 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> I took it to a LAN party once
Sep 24 10:48:34 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> you have a decent laptop that becomes a workstation when you're at home, and you can bring your workstation with you if you really need to
Sep 24 10:49:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Thanos the tank engine> >you start training an AI on it, the heat output raising the temperature of the building noticeably
Sep 24 10:49:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Thanos the tank engine> >people start leaving, throwing dirty looks at you
Sep 24 10:49:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Thanos the tank engine> >they're still just jealous
Sep 24 10:49:29 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> I was tempted by the Flow X13 which takes this concept to the extreme (small ultrabook-ish device with a 3080 eGPU), but it was ungodly expensive
Sep 24 10:50:13 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> dsimic: then clearly you're not the target market for an egpu :P
Sep 24 10:50:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> oh, I agree: but that's what I mean, you can't really extend the laptop internally in a way that will make it substantially more powerful
Sep 24 10:50:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> WiFi can be engineered into the device in this hypothetical future
Sep 24 10:50:59 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Thanosthetankengine> the entire point of egpus and things like convergence on phones is just having one device
Sep 24 10:51:26 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> My pinebook already has the best SSD I own lol
Sep 24 10:51:27 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> RAID on a laptop is a possible outcome, but again, probably not the target market for a PBU
Sep 24 10:52:02 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> you're not making it weaker though, imo! :p
Sep 24 10:52:21 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> I don't see much point in RAID unless you've already got like 4-6 drives lol
Sep 24 10:52:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> true, but my opinion is the number of use cases enabled by external connectivity outweighs that of internal connectivity
Sep 24 10:52:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> It's just not cost effective otherwise
Sep 24 10:53:24 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> dsimic: in theory at least, connecting the SSD to a multiphy would only lose you 50mb/s at most, at least on slower drives like the 660p which I already think is plenty fast enough
Sep 24 10:54:03 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> The biggest hit would actually be wifi because you'd be stuck with SDIO modules rather than PCIe
Sep 24 10:54:23 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> I'm not exhausting the cache lol
Sep 24 10:55:15 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Thanos the tank engine> so yeah there's a tradeoff
Sep 24 10:55:32 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Absolutely, but I also don't particularly care about wifi performance as long as it's faster than my internet connection so in this theoretical world I don't care about the small performance loss from a setup like that
Sep 24 10:55:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Even the PBPs current WiFi module is adequate for me
Sep 24 10:56:20 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> So yes in this theoretical world I don't actually lose any significant SSD or wifi performance
Sep 24 10:56:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Thanos the tank engine> splitting t5he 4 lanes from the pcie3.0 into 2 sets of 2 lanes could be fun for putting 2 SSDs in RAID
Sep 24 10:56:43 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> If the controller supports it
Sep 24 10:57:04 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> only four lanes is pretty limiting though :(
Sep 24 10:57:14 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Four lanes is quite a bit at 3.0 speeds
Sep 24 10:57:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> 32gbit/s
Sep 24 10:57:31 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Thanos the tank engine> two drives in a raid1 could be faster than one drive with the full bandwidth
Sep 24 10:57:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I'd be surprised if the interconnect rockchip designs will be able to handle that much tbh
Sep 24 10:58:32 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Thanos the tank engine> in a raid0 you'd get fdaster everything but no redundancy
Sep 24 10:58:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Thanos the tank engine> raid1 would have the redundancy benefits at least
Sep 24 10:58:58 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> We can only hope rockchip sees this as an opportunity to create a future proof design (like with the 32gb ram limit) so they iron out the bottlenecks before they can become a problem in the next generation
Sep 24 10:59:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> can a PCIE 3.0 lane be bifurcated into two PCIE 2.0 lanes?
Sep 24 11:00:06 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> It wouldn't be 2.0 lanes
Sep 24 11:00:26 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> If it can it would be splitting it into two 3.0 2x lanes yeah
Sep 24 11:00:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Or possibly even something like one 3.0 1x and one 3.0 3x
Sep 24 11:00:53 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> iirc there's technically nothing stopping PCIe from working with odd numbers of lanes
Sep 24 11:01:25 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Non standard of course
Sep 24 11:01:34 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> But theoretically I think they can work
Sep 24 11:01:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I'm pretty sure there's also at least one 32x implementation
Sep 24 11:02:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Bah that's semantics :P
Sep 24 11:03:18 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> ah right, I thought 3.0 was double 2.0 but that's only true of 4.0 and above
Sep 24 11:03:28 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> No 3.0 is double 2.0
Sep 24 11:03:31 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Just as 2.0 is double 1.0
Sep 24 11:03:45 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> negatory, 2.0 is 5 GT/s, 3.0 is 8 GT/s
Sep 24 11:03:54 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Almost double :P
Sep 24 11:04:18 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> iirc the real world numbers for 2.0 are actually 4gt/s
Sep 24 11:04:36 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> yeah, I was just wondering if it was possible to reconfigure a PCI-E 3.0 port with 4 lanes into a PCI-E 2.0 port with 8 lanes essentially
Sep 24 11:04:38 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> And for 3.0 they're like 7.8gt/s or something
Sep 24 11:04:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Yeah no
Sep 24 11:04:53 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> yep, that's what I thought
Sep 24 11:04:58 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> ah well :-)
Sep 24 11:05:05 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Part of how 3.0 got extra speed was reducing error correction btw
Sep 24 11:05:27 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Those 5/8 numbers are theoretical numbers before encoding yeah
Sep 24 11:06:02 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I'm fairly certain it's before
Sep 24 11:06:13 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Because PCIe 2.0 x1 is 500MB/s real world
Sep 24 11:06:24 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Which is 4GT/s
Sep 24 11:06:26 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Not 5
Sep 24 11:08:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Oh weird
Sep 24 11:09:32 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> well, we're dreaming - take the Framework approach and turn the PCI-E interface into a modular component that you can switch out to a M.2 port or a Thunderbolt port as you wish :P
Sep 24 11:11:26 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Oh also talking about thunderbolt again, I've got more uses for it than just egpus so for someone like me a TB mod for the pbp could actually be insanely useful
Sep 24 11:11:26 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Note how I say mod, because for 99% of people it wouldn't make sense, I just happen to be the 1% of people crazy enough that something like that might just work :P
Sep 24 11:13:52 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> @Segfault I'll take the bait, what do you use TB for?
Sep 24 11:14:22 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Well, GPUs, high speed networking and storage, and other small things that involve PCIe
Sep 24 11:14:23 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> they mentioned other uses
Sep 24 11:15:22 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Oh the experiments I could run if I could plug a box into my PBP with a PCIe slot in it
Sep 24 11:16:16 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I've got the box :)
Sep 24 11:16:17 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/463285150898192384/890995058545917992/unknown.jpeg
Sep 24 11:16:43 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Electr0Lyte> he's got a box
Sep 24 11:16:54 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Yeah but it's nowhere near as convenient having a whole separate machine to my laptop to connect things like that to
Sep 24 11:17:46 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> what's the 3x PCIe 2.0 used for if you don't use the SATA port?
Sep 24 11:18:03 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> On the RK3588?
Sep 24 11:18:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> yup
Sep 24 11:18:18 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I think only two of the multiphys will have PCIe
Sep 24 11:18:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> So it's actually 2x PCIe 2.0 x1 I'm pretty sure
Sep 24 11:18:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Theoretically one would be used for an m.2 E key slot so you can use a pcie wifi module
Sep 24 11:19:10 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> The other one... beats me...
Sep 24 11:19:16 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
Sep 24 11:19:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> That 3x PCIe 2.0 comes from a cnx article which I'm pretty sure is riddled with errors
Sep 24 11:20:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I think they mistook 3 multiphys as 3 PCIe 2.0 controllers
Sep 24 11:20:42 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I'd imagine the rk3588 will probably have a multiphy layout similar to the RK3568
Sep 24 11:21:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> At least one of the controllers should be configured the same way it is on the quartz, so SATA/PCIe
Sep 24 11:21:56 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> And I think one will be configured for USB 3.0/SATA
Sep 24 11:22:05 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> But I'm not sure on that
Sep 24 11:22:16 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> And I don't know what the 3rd one is configured as
Sep 24 11:22:24 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Again, check the RK3568 specs
Sep 24 11:22:50 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Nono I think it's 2 separate pcie 2.0 x1 links assuming all multiphys that can be used for PCIe are
Sep 24 11:23:02 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> https://eji4evk5kxx.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/RK3588-Rockchip-Developer-Conference-2020.jpg
Sep 24 11:23:29 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> I believe that says, exactly, "three lanes PCI-e 2.0/SATA 3.0"
Sep 24 11:23:32 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> make of that what you will
Sep 24 11:25:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> also while researching this, I saw this, and that seems like tough pricing to make
Sep 24 11:25:31 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/463285150898192384/890997380881711154/unknown.png
Sep 24 11:25:33 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> time will tell I suppose
Sep 24 11:26:39 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Maybe see if they had a similar slide for the RK3568? Since that's actually been released we could compare what they said to what we got
Sep 24 11:28:46 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Ignore the pcie 3.0 controller in that diagram btw, that's specific to the RK3568, sort of like the 3.0 x4 controller in the 3588
Sep 24 11:29:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> yep I think that image is from the same conference (Rockchip DC 2020)
Sep 24 11:29:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> it's September 2021, where did the time go? :-)
Sep 24 11:29:21 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> That sounds hopeful for the 3588 3.0 controller doing the same then
Sep 24 11:30:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/463285150898192384/890998679845085244/unknown.jpeg
Sep 24 11:30:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> That's the 3568
Sep 24 11:30:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Those muxes are the multiphys
Sep 24 11:31:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I would imagine the 3588 will be laid out the same way
Sep 24 11:31:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Although maybe not because that only has a single pcie 2.0 controller
Sep 24 11:32:13 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Maybe mux0 on the rk3588 will also have another pcie2.0 controller or something
Sep 24 11:32:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> And iirc compared to that image the 3566 deleted the qsgmii controller and mux0
Sep 24 11:32:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> As well as the PCIe 3.0 contriller
Sep 24 11:43:13 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Potentially?
Sep 24 11:43:28 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I think it can do at least three although idk how qsgmii works
Sep 24 11:44:51 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Oh I see
Sep 24 11:44:54 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Interesting
Sep 24 11:45:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> So yeah I guess the RK3568 can run 6 Ethernet ports directly with the right hardware
Sep 24 11:45:38 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Why not both :P
Sep 24 11:45:47 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Wouldn't qsgmii give you better performance?
Sep 24 11:46:04 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Because you've got a direct link to every port
Sep 24 11:46:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Does increasing packet size markedly decrease CPU use?
Sep 24 11:47:49 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I wonder if the CPU would be powerful enough to route the theoretical what 12gbit/s of 9000mtu packets you could do with that many Ethernet ports lol
Sep 24 11:48:25 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> That is a **lot** of packets lol
Sep 24 11:48:54 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Although for applications where maximum performance isn't needed it might be a good idea anyway because it gives you better firewalling ability and such
Sep 24 11:50:39 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> It's crazy how Rockchip finds new ways to make their chips so versatile lol
Sep 24 11:51:00 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I mean the RK3568 could do so many things, it could be a high end router one minute and a NAS the next
Sep 24 11:51:17 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Or even a phone! :P
Sep 24 11:52:04 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I mean hell this generation they were like "hmm this chip doesn't do enough stuff, let's just let it *modify itself on the fly*" with muxes :P
Sep 24 16:18:47 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> android: strange chats go into the offtopic channel
Sep 25 13:10:24 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <saifage> PINEPHONE will ship to India in future?
Sep 25 13:12:04 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> @Avamander could you add the general Pine64 chat and the lts-and-sopine channel to your Matrix space? And maybe one or two of the admins
Sep 25 13:12:38 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> saifage: not as of now. Pine tried it but there have been severe issues with the customs, from how I've understood it
Sep 25 13:17:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Avamander> Provide the full channel address
Sep 25 13:18:45 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> https://riot.im/app/#/room/#pine64:matrix.org (#pine64:matrix.org) and https://riot.im/app/#/room/#pine64sopine:matrix.org (#pine64sopine:matrix.org), see https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/Main_Page#Chat_Platforms. Thankks, @Avamander
Sep 25 13:21:43 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Avamander> Done
Sep 25 13:21:51 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> üëç
Sep 25 14:10:51 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Thanos the tank engine> Yeah, I have been told that indian customs made it practically impossible for Pine to send anything there

Sep 25 19:29:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <Aleks> Hi everyone. Anyone knows why the delivery in Europe(I had ordered pinephone) it‚Äôs taking so long, waiting already more than 2 weeks, is that normal?!!

Sep 25 20:21:07 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <pinaperr> hey, i received a pinephone a couple of months ago and only yesterday i had the opportunity to try it. at first it ran ok, although i did see some error message on booting. now though the screen is turned off every second, sometimes when i touch it and sometimes just by itself. totally unusable. i'm running the default os (manjaro) and i did play with the screen settings, but this behaviors doesn't make any sense.

Sep 26 02:59:36 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Sameer9793> can i ask for support about linux on amlogic devices here? they are basically a SBC now
Sep 26 03:00:34 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Electr0Lyte> sorry server is meant for discussing Pine64 devices
Sep 26 03:00:36 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <gamiee> PINE64 doesn't have any devices with amlogic SoCs, so this is not correct place, although, you can try to ask in #offtopic and maybe someone will help you
Sep 26 03:01:16 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Sameer9793> oaky, thanks for the help.

Sep 26 23:28:54 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <benjamin_southern> whats up with this "Pine64 Protocol Droid" bot? Are these just messages from Telegram/Discord? I was under the impression that matrix bridges would allow for non-matrix messages to still show up without the need for a bot like this...
Sep 27 00:19:46 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <pinaperr> can anyone here help me? not sure what to do
Sep 27 00:21:07 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <Strit> That depends entirely on what your issue is.
Sep 27 00:21:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <pinaperr> i wrote yesterday. here it is: "hey, i received a pinephone a couple of months ago and only yesterday i had the opportunity to try it. at first it ran ok, although i did see some error message on booting. now though the screen is turned off every second, sometimes when i touch it and sometimes just by itself. totally unusable. i'm running the default os (manjaro) and i did play with the screen settings, but this b
Sep 27 00:22:54 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <Strit> It's made by the screen settings KCM writing bogus config files. Remove the ~/.config/powermanagementrc file if you can (maybe through JumpDrive on an SD card)

Sep 27 01:47:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <mbohun> pinaperr: same over here, i got my PinePhone in the end of June 2021. The manjaro + plasma-mobile installed on it are not for everyday use. Plus the modem was dying often even after 2 hours, etc.
Sep 27 01:47:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <mbohun> HOWEVER then I installed postmarketOS phosh (the edge version) - and now I always smile, works really good
Sep 27 10:48:41 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> @Philpax that and how Pine links then. IRC has a server linked, Discord has an invite link public and Matrix and Telegram both link individual channels, both also have a spam issue here
Sep 27 14:11:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <_deepfire> dsimic, maybe you also could voice that in the forum thread? : -)
Sep 27 14:24:41 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <quantomworks> Are there any plans to use matrix?
Sep 27 15:14:20 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <cyckl> can confirm, am typing this from matrix

Sep 27 21:20:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Mk> Hello Anyone have the link to download the latest Ubuntu touch version for pinephone thanks?
Sep 27 22:00:33 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Caleb Christopher Fontenot> I use #offtopic and #pinephone so often I forgot there was a general channel lol
Sep 28 00:07:00 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> The general chat is new. Like a week old @CCF_100
Sep 28 00:08:23 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> @Mk see https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/PinePhone_Software_Releases#Ubuntu_Touch
Sep 28 00:23:50 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <Strit> In matrix the topic for this channel reads: "General discussion for the Pine64 Chat Network. Product-specific questions and discussion and better suited to other chats."
Sep 28 00:27:03 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> Yeah, but new folks will ask specific product questions here anyway. That is something to life with, IMO.
Sep 28 00:30:42 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> Its also laziness. Ask in the first channel you can find. Same like people asking things you have to look up yourself just to get the link, what the asking persons could have done themselves.
Sep 28 02:19:47 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <Ben Finney> I asked questions about "free-software open-design alternative to FitBit, where the user has full control over their own data"
Sep 28 02:20:13 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <Ben Finney> and was led to the PineTime. It does a lot more than I'd need from such a device but seems to have the right sensors and connectivity.
Sep 28 02:21:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <Ben Finney> How well does it make the data avilable? Are there standard "show me data from my wearable" apps for GNU+Linux, and for LineageOS, which work with this?
Sep 28 02:38:12 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <gamiee> Hi Ben Finney, I recommend you to join PineTime Matrix channel, you can find link on our wiki page https://wiki.pine64.org/ :)
Sep 28 11:53:49 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fervi> I think there is a bug with pine64 website. You have one (old version) of website without www and newest with www.
Sep 28 11:58:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <gamiee> what? :o
Sep 28 11:59:02 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <UniversalSuperBox> https://pine64.org should redirect to https://www.pine64.org. It does for me...
Sep 28 12:05:22 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Julian Zb.> I tried it too - works for me
Sep 28 12:06:26 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Julian Zb.> There is also https://pine64.com/, which I am pretty sure is a different site intentionally
Sep 28 12:13:01 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> @fervi test again with pressing control+F5 to reload your local cache
Sep 28 12:14:16 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fervi> @Funeral Maybe the bug is, cause I get a website to old version
Sep 28 12:14:17 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fervi> I mean
Sep 28 12:14:18 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fervi> https://pine64.com/product-category/single-board-computers/
Sep 28 12:14:45 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fervi> sorry - anyway, it should be removed or just merged
Sep 28 12:14:49 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> That's the shop, which is a different site and a different organization behind it
Sep 28 12:15:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fervi> ok, but if you then click on "Home button", the redirect wont work
Sep 28 12:15:26 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> The store has more issues than that üòõ
Sep 28 12:15:33 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fervi> ok üòõ
Sep 28 12:15:46 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> Click on Cart > Orders while having an empty cart for example
Sep 28 12:28:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fervi> But is the shop open source?
Sep 28 12:28:52 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> You mean the shop software? üòÑ
Sep 28 12:28:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fervi> yep
Sep 28 12:29:06 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fervi> Maybe I should add some bugs
Sep 28 12:29:07 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fervi> üòõ
Sep 28 12:29:56 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> Looks like Wordpress but enhancing the site is not a focus üòõ

Sep 28 13:00:27 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fervi> ok
Sep 28 13:00:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <Magnus> im on the defoult that came with the phone how can i check to make sure?
Sep 28 13:01:13 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <Strit> I would suggest updating via terminal/pacman instead of discover.
Sep 28 13:01:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <Strit> Discover has issues with pacman 6 / packagekit for some reason.
Sep 28 13:02:02 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <Magnus> okay thx
Sep 28 13:02:23 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fervi> Anyway - is there any news about supporting Bitcoin in Pine64 payments?

Sep 28 14:23:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <gamiee> uuuuh llvmpipe
Sep 28 14:26:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <Strit> I would have thought Arch would be using Lima like the rest of us on mainline kernel.
Sep 28 14:34:12 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <errquilibria> I found the wayland driver from sunxi50i-a64 support site is the smoothest and supporting graphic acceleration, not that it's a large device but I get about 28 fps in 720p resolution
Sep 28 14:35:10 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <errquilibria> Yeah it picked the llvm automatically (re @p64protocolbot: [D] <gamiee> uuuuh llvmpipe)
Sep 28 14:35:54 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <errquilibria> How does Lima differ from llvm
Sep 28 14:36:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <Strit> Lima is a hardware driver, where llvm is a software driver I believe.
Sep 28 14:36:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <Strit> So llvm will use the CPU instead of the GPU.
Sep 28 14:38:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <errquilibria> Oh OK, I'll look into that, wayland is a kernel driver though but I'll see if there is Lima support on this mali-400 etc hardware (re @p64protocolbot: [M] <Strit> Lima is a hardware driver, where llvm is a software driver I believe.)
Sep 28 14:39:16 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <Strit> You can check in your kernel with `zgrep LIMA /proc/config.gz`.
Sep 28 14:39:25 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <errquilibria> Ah yes, I understand, interesting stuff (re @p64protocolbot: [M] <Strit> So llvm will use the CPU instead of the GPU.)
Sep 28 14:40:39 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <errquilibria> I'll have a look yes thx for the info, it's bit late by me, almost 10 pm so will see tomorrow (re @p64protocolbot: [M] <Strit> You can check in your kernel with `zgrep LIMA /proc/config.gz`.)
Sep 28 14:41:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <errquilibria> I'll look @ arch wiki solong tho

Sep 28 15:06:42 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <FlyFrog> Is there someone from the store support here?
Sep 28 15:07:31 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <UniversalSuperBox> No, you won't find store support here. But pine64.com is the pine64 store. You can email the support address listed on pine64.com for order help. But you won't receive anything but your order confirmation until the item ships, which depending on the item could be several weeks.

Sep 29 00:15:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> c2a1: A64 devices will load the bootloader from an SD card first if one is available so those are effectively unbrickable
Sep 29 00:15:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> RK3399 devices are a bit more tricky, they'll load from eMMC first, so a physical switch is included that disconnects the eMMC if needed
Sep 29 00:16:00 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Although before even that they'll load from SPI so if you want some reassurance you can also flash the SPI chip on devices that have it like the PBP

Sep 29 17:17:53 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <SteelCaptain üá∑üá¥ ‚©© [ milsugi ] [ miolingi ]> Doesnt discord have a web client
Sep 29 17:20:24 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <5SpeedFatty> yes but the useragent on the pinephone is setup to make it think you are on android, which blocks that part of the site form access
Sep 29 17:20:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <5SpeedFatty> im sure i could fake it but the thought was see what teh community uses before i go poking
Sep 29 17:20:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <5SpeedFatty> im sure i could fake it but the thought was see what the community uses before i go poking
Sep 29 17:26:29 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <SteelCaptain üá∑üá¥ ‚©© [ milsugi ] [ miolingi ]> Useragent changer addons can be made to work on a per site basis
Sep 29 17:27:12 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <SteelCaptain üá∑üá¥ ‚©© [ milsugi ] [ miolingi ]> Im sure its possible in both firefox and chrom*um
Sep 29 17:27:28 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <5SpeedFatty> so far havent installed firefox
Sep 29 17:27:41 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <5SpeedFatty> was checking it out on "anglefish"
Sep 29 17:28:56 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <SteelCaptain üá∑üá¥ ‚©© [ milsugi ] [ miolingi ]> It looks more mobile friendly
Sep 29 17:29:15 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <SteelCaptain üá∑üá¥ ‚©© [ milsugi ] [ miolingi ]> I dont own a pinephone
Sep 29 17:29:53 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <SteelCaptain üá∑üá¥ ‚©© [ milsugi ] [ miolingi ]> But you could try firefox too and also falkon
Sep 29 17:29:54 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <5SpeedFatty> yea i just got mine and im poking around seeign what the default OS looks like bfore i flash the multi image on it and go looking around
Sep 29 17:31:12 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <SteelCaptain üá∑üá¥ ‚©© [ milsugi ] [ miolingi ]> Im more interested in the smartwatch
Sep 29 17:32:01 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <5SpeedFatty> i messed up and didnt pay for the good shipping on my watch
Sep 29 17:32:05 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <5SpeedFatty> its not here yet
Sep 29 17:32:41 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <SteelCaptain üá∑üá¥ ‚©© [ milsugi ] [ miolingi ]> Shipping is very expensive
Sep 29 17:33:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <SteelCaptain üá∑üá¥ ‚©© [ milsugi ] [ miolingi ]> Ill buy 3 if the shipping costs as much as one
Sep 29 17:33:23 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <5SpeedFatty> yea... still the phone shipped out all of 2 days ago
Sep 29 17:33:47 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <5SpeedFatty> and the better shipping had it here in that time
Sep 29 17:35:58 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <SteelCaptain üá∑üá¥ ‚©© [ milsugi ] [ miolingi ]> Would it be possible to make firefox for desktop have the mobile style of tabs via extensions?

Sep 30 04:09:41 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Krissy Silveropossum> I'd recommend editing the user agent in `about:config`
Sep 30 04:09:41 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Krissy Silveropossum> 
Sep 30 04:09:42 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Krissy Silveropossum> Leave everything the same, but *specifically* replace "Android" with "Linux"
Sep 30 04:09:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Krissy Silveropossum> 
Sep 30 04:09:45 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Krissy Silveropossum> Many websites will stop trying to harass you about android apps but will still present their mobile UIs
Sep 30 04:11:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> Better install an user agent switcher add-on. Sites detect the presence of a mobile phone in different ways, changing the user agent back to desktop will break a large amount of sites.
Sep 30 04:12:10 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Krissy Silveropossum> This does not change the user agent to desktop
Sep 30 04:12:39 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Krissy Silveropossum> The user agent string in this case still contains the word "Mobile", which appears to be what any site I've encountered thus far is relying on
Sep 30 04:12:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Krissy Silveropossum> if not the dimensions of screen, etc.
Sep 30 04:16:31 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <yerbkhan> me and my buddy want to order 2 devices, but there is 1 device limit per order, is it possible to make it 2 cuz we are 2 persons? order is in EU
Sep 30 04:17:04 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Cyastis> have you tried..
Sep 30 04:17:04 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Cyastis> 
Sep 30 04:17:06 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Cyastis> changing privacy.resistFingerprinting to True?
Sep 30 04:17:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Cyastis> Because that'll make the userAgent show Windows NT
Sep 30 04:17:59 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Cyastis> yerbkhan I think you'd have to order them separately unfortunately
Sep 30 04:18:23 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Cyastis> it's a carrier limit, not an arbitrary limit pine64 makes
Sep 30 04:20:45 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <thanos the they/them engine> yeah it's an issue of what they can send in the package, noy who orders it
Sep 30 04:21:49 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> To be fair, for the EU warehouse that doesn't apply, they are holding a stock there. But Pine probably can't or won't make the order process region-specific
Sep 30 04:21:50 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <thanos the they/them engine> wait that actually works? I'd have assumed that they were just using the fact that it's a mobile layout to decide to shill the app
Sep 30 04:22:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Krissy Silveropossum> Based on my experience, they're just looking for the word "Android" in the user a gent
Sep 30 04:22:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Krissy Silveropossum> Based on my experience, they're just looking for the word "Android" in the user agent

Sep 30 04:23:25 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Krissy Silveropossum> Nothing is more annoying than reddit trying to thrust its app upon me, imo XD
Sep 30 04:23:31 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <thanos the they/them engine> might not be a bad idea to put this in a PR
Sep 30 04:24:23 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Krissy Silveropossum> I think that'd be a better default user agent personally
Sep 30 04:24:28 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Krissy Silveropossum> also more technically accurate X3
Sep 30 04:25:01 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <thanos the they/them engine> if ti stops the app shilling then it already significantly improves the experience
