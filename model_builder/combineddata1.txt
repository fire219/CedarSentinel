Sep 22 00:51:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@mbohun> Is there actually a plan for a Pine64 "car dash-cam recording system" ?
Sep 22 00:51:58 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@mbohun> - modular/extensible
Sep 22 00:52:00 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@mbohun> - i would really love to build one with night vision / heat sensor for wildlife detection/avoidance (kangaroos, deer, wombats, echidnas, foxes, etc. EVERYWHERE! )
Sep 22 00:53:25 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@mbohun> yes, that is what i meant, pine64 seems to have all the different parts
Sep 22 00:53:33 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@mbohun> already

Sep 22 02:44:28 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@gamelaster (gamiee)> it should be possible with to do with Allwinner S3 which is currently used in PineCube

Sep 22 11:14:47 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@Strit> 
Sep 22 11:14:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@Strit> I don't think so. Because of some customs law.
Sep 22 11:15:38 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@arch frajer sa frizurom> are you going to fer, too, perchance?
Sep 22 11:26:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Funeral> Rahulraj: nah, they don't ship to India

Sep 22 12:29:17 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <@L> That's my last alternative
Sep 22 12:29:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <@L> I don't know if was shipped or not
Sep 22 12:29:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> You get two emails, one with an order confirmation and one later on with a tracking number
Sep 22 12:30:07 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> If you haven't received the second email then it hasn't shipped yet

Sep 22 17:15:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> Hi guys!!
Sep 22 17:15:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> i have a question about shipping
Sep 22 17:15:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Funeral> Spit it out
Sep 22 17:16:24 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> if i ordered one pinephone and 2x pinetime, How can I find out when it will be at my address?
Sep 22 17:16:46 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> date field on site not working
Sep 22 17:17:03 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Funeral> You could order the PinePhone only individually, without the pinetime. For both orders you will get a mail with the tracking number once it ships
Sep 22 17:17:10 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Funeral> Which date field?
Sep 22 17:17:39 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Funeral> Or are you asking how long it would roughly take?
Sep 22 17:17:51 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> I have a flight on the 9th of next month it has to catch up
Sep 22 17:18:15 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> we can say from today until october 8
Sep 22 17:18:21 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Funeral> They ship from China and the PinePhone is usually a pre-order depending on your location
Sep 22 17:18:51 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> i'm in pennsylvania
Sep 22 17:19:12 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Funeral> Then it also depends on the shipping method, courier or slow shipping üòõ
Sep 22 17:20:01 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> May I know roughly how long it takes in America?
Sep 22 17:27:10 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Funeral> Nah, that's not possible
Sep 22 17:27:16 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Funeral> 3 to 40 days
Sep 22 17:28:45 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Funeral> Like said, it's a pre-order, there are different shipping methods
Sep 22 17:28:46 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> OMG
Sep 22 17:28:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> thanks man!
Sep 22 17:29:00 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> thats bad for me :(
Sep 22 17:29:17 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> i want to get pinephone but i will leave from USA
Sep 22 17:29:26 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> and you are not shipping Turkey yet
Sep 22 17:30:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Funeral> Well, did you order courier or standard and when?
Sep 22 17:31:21 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <@taner.veriyol> I haven't done it yet, I'm looking for the fastest way
Sep 22 17:31:51 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Funeral> courier is fast but it's a pre-order üòÑ
Sep 22 17:32:47 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Funeral> The PinePhone ships roughly twice a month, so with some unlucky timing it might not reach you in time
Sep 22 18:36:51 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@GCJohnsonChevalier> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/463285150898192384/890381157961723934/2021-09-22-163552.webm
Sep 22 18:37:25 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@GCJohnsonChevalier> @fireTwoOneNine custom GPU on the PinePhone64 System on a Chip ?
Sep 22 18:40:16 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@fireTwoOneNine> the GPU on the pinephone is built into the same chip as the CPU
Sep 22 19:28:12 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@gamiee> @PiZZaMartijn i guess this is good idea
Sep 22 19:33:49 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@notLillie> I want more boards
Sep 22 19:34:12 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@notLillie> what would you all buy? üòõ
Sep 22 19:34:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@notLillie> I don‚Äôt have any pine64 SBCs, excluding the pinetime, and pinebook pro
Sep 22 19:36:50 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@notLillie> These two I won‚Äôt buy (quartz maybe later)
Sep 22 19:36:51 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@notLillie> Quartz64: No, waiting for that one to mature. (Mostly because of the USB issue.)
Sep 22 19:36:52 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@notLillie> Pine A64: far too slow.
Sep 22 19:38:58 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@notLillie> I guess that leaves the rockpro64. Rock64 is starting to show its age anyways‚Ä¶ üòõ
Sep 22 19:43:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@caleb (they/them)> @GAMELASTER i like your banner !
Sep 22 19:43:31 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> @GAMELASTER having devzone be public is not a good idea
Sep 22 19:44:23 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@gamiee> Not everything public, only parts which could be public
Sep 22 19:44:28 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@gamiee> Thanks üòÄ
Sep 22 19:44:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> that eeh, mostly will keep it down to nothing
Sep 22 19:44:53 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@caleb (they/them)> surely anything that would be public on devzone should be on the wiki instead
Sep 22 19:44:58 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> yes
Sep 22 19:45:00 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> exactly
Sep 22 19:56:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@gamiee> That's true
Sep 22 20:23:14 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> because stuff shows up there before it's announced
Sep 22 20:24:56 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> exactly
Sep 22 20:26:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> yup
Sep 22 20:26:53 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> but that's mostly done in the public channels
Sep 22 20:28:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> ofcourse everything is as open as possible, but not everything can be public, which is why this needs to exist
Sep 22 20:29:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> it's not like all the open developments is going away üòõ
Sep 22 20:30:18 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> you seem to think that the things that are in devzone were public before
Sep 22 20:31:15 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@caleb (they/them)> there isn't much reason for development work for current devices to happen on devzone
Sep 22 20:31:31 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@caleb (they/them)> the wiki, public channels and mailing lists are far better platforms
Sep 22 20:31:51 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@caleb (they/them)> i don't think there's any intention of devzone being used for active development of stuff that you can go buy
Sep 22 20:32:06 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> no the current projects are listed in the devzone
Sep 22 20:32:12 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> so far nothing has happened on them
Sep 22 20:32:32 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> devzone is also just neat to keep track of who has which devkits etc, this is not replacing all the open development
Sep 22 20:33:18 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@caleb (they/them)> there's obviously no benefit to gatekeeping development efforts, that would kinda defeat the purpose of pine64... to the best of my knowledge it's not something anyone ever planned as a usecase for it
Sep 22 20:33:28 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@caleb (they/them)> for the reasons you've stated - it would be dumb
Sep 22 20:35:05 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> devzone is the bucket where all the small features are thrown in that are needed for organizing
Sep 22 20:36:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> no, features for organizing. like developer lists, the signup stuff, timeline tracking
Sep 22 20:36:33 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@caleb (they/them)> ie for the people who are being sent devices for the purposes of working on them
Sep 22 20:36:43 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> there definetly is
Sep 22 20:36:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> there are plenty of reasons
Sep 22 20:36:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> do you want to publicly list all the GDPR protected contact info of developers?
Sep 22 20:37:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> timeline might be public, but it's not exciting at all, and mostly used for tracking products that are not public yet
Sep 22 20:37:51 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> something something D1 SBC :>
Sep 22 20:38:05 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> although I'm still trying to figure out whether I want that
Sep 22 20:38:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> I'll probably get it just for the novelty of RISC-V that's not a softcore
Sep 22 20:40:34 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> that's not the intention ofcourse, and most of that development is already done split over the public chats here thanks to all the bridging that's done so devs on all platforms can talk together
Sep 22 20:40:47 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> and a lot of development just happens in distribution specific chat channels
Sep 22 20:42:02 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> I'm not a -huge- fan of knowledge being gated behind devzone, but my understanding is that it is primarily for knowledge that can't be shared for legal or other reasons
Sep 22 20:42:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> if there is any info that _can_ be public, it _is_ public
Sep 22 20:42:27 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> the development talks you refer to already happen outside of devzone
Sep 22 20:45:12 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> mm, same
Sep 22 20:45:26 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> I guess we'll see, I'm hoping for the best
Sep 22 20:46:04 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> I'll be signing up for devzone once I get some working devices going and can do some dev
Sep 22 20:49:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> I think, if the decision to publicise something is made because of policy, that the battle has already been lost
Sep 22 20:49:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> This only really works if people want their work to be public
Sep 22 20:50:59 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> heh, who doesn't want credit
Sep 22 20:51:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@PiZZaMartijn> it's not like the developers are pine64 developers and they start working in-company now, the developers working on pine products usually do that because they like working in the open üôÇ
Sep 22 20:53:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@‚ô¶ –ëÃ∏ÃîÃà–∞Ã∂ÃãÃΩ—ÄÃ∂ÕêÕÇ–æÃµÃáÃü–ΩÃ∂ÃíÃê ‚ô¶> I want to apologize to the dev teams for the PR nightmare, and express my gratitude for the fact you didn't permaban me the moment I walked in here

Sep 24 00:38:05 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Ocawesome101> dsimic: they support thunderbolt 4 iirc
Sep 24 01:39:50 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@arch frajer sa frizurom> i thought bpfilter is abandoned?
Sep 24 02:30:29 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <@P. Salvatore> Buongiorno. Sono interessato all'acquisto del Pinenote, sono residente in Italia, ma sul sito www.pine64.org/pinenote/ non si puo' accedere alla procedura di acqisto. C'√® una alternativa? Grazie
Sep 24 02:32:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> Hey we try to keep discussion here in English, it's easier to moderate that way and you're more likely to get a response
Sep 24 02:32:56 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> As for the question, the pinenote isn't available for purchase yet as far as I can tell, it'll be available soon as a development unit though
Sep 24 10:43:58 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> With m.2 E key you could absolutely solder wires to take the SDIO and UART connections for a wifi module elsewhere while still leaving the PCIe connection on the multiphy PCIe connection in place for an SSD in that slot
Sep 24 10:44:00 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> what would you do with a PCIe 4x inside the laptop, dsimic? the only thing I can really think of is storage or the LiteFury or something
Sep 24 10:44:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> (to be clear, I agree with you, I think having as much in the laptop is good, but I'm trying to figure out what you could actually add here)
Sep 24 10:44:42 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Thanos the tank engine> imagine the bottleneck factor of ann RTX 3090 connected to the rk3588 based pinebook pro pro
Sep 24 10:44:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> And the beauty of it all is that if that big PCIe controller plays nice with GPUs and thunderbolt then there's literally no reason that idea couldn't work in theory
Sep 24 10:44:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> (nobody ships GPUs on NVMe, do they? :P)
Sep 24 10:45:01 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> M.2, bah, I keep mixing those up
Sep 24 10:45:17 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Thanos the tank engine> no, GPUs on M.2 are not a thing
Sep 24 10:45:27 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> There are framebuffer/blitter units that output over vga but that's it
Sep 24 10:45:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Thanos the tank engine> not exactly super useful
Sep 24 10:45:59 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> @Thanos the tank engine sometimes you just need to machine learn at a coffee shop and your RTX 3090
Sep 24 10:47:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> So yeah if I ever disappear for a few months after we get an RK3588 pinebook you can probably assume I've gone into some kind of "I will not go online until I finish this crazy project and make a blog post about it" thing lol
Sep 24 10:47:33 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> dsimic: my home setup it a ThinkPad with an external RX 570
Sep 24 10:47:38 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> I will cheer you on Segfault o7
Sep 24 10:47:52 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Thanos the tank engine> >sets down Pinebook on table at coffee shop
Sep 24 10:47:53 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Thanos the tank engine> >pulls RTX 3090 eGPU out of bag and sets it on the floor, plugging it in to the nearest outlet
Sep 24 10:47:54 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Thanos the tank engine> >the lights dim for a second as the sheer power of your rig is too much for the building to handle
Sep 24 10:47:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Thanos the tank engine> >all the peasants are staring at you, jealous of your rig
Sep 24 10:48:07 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> I took it to a LAN party once
Sep 24 10:48:34 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> you have a decent laptop that becomes a workstation when you're at home, and you can bring your workstation with you if you really need to
Sep 24 10:49:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Thanos the tank engine> >you start training an AI on it, the heat output raising the temperature of the building noticeably
Sep 24 10:49:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Thanos the tank engine> >people start leaving, throwing dirty looks at you
Sep 24 10:49:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Thanos the tank engine> >they're still just jealous
Sep 24 10:49:29 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> I was tempted by the Flow X13 which takes this concept to the extreme (small ultrabook-ish device with a 3080 eGPU), but it was ungodly expensive
Sep 24 10:50:13 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> dsimic: then clearly you're not the target market for an egpu :P
Sep 24 10:50:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> oh, I agree: but that's what I mean, you can't really extend the laptop internally in a way that will make it substantially more powerful
Sep 24 10:50:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> WiFi can be engineered into the device in this hypothetical future
Sep 24 10:50:59 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Thanosthetankengine> the entire point of egpus and things like convergence on phones is just having one device
Sep 24 10:51:26 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> My pinebook already has the best SSD I own lol
Sep 24 10:51:27 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> RAID on a laptop is a possible outcome, but again, probably not the target market for a PBU
Sep 24 10:52:02 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> you're not making it weaker though, imo! :p
Sep 24 10:52:21 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> I don't see much point in RAID unless you've already got like 4-6 drives lol
Sep 24 10:52:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Philpax> true, but my opinion is the number of use cases enabled by external connectivity outweighs that of internal connectivity
Sep 24 10:52:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> It's just not cost effective otherwise
Sep 24 10:53:24 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> dsimic: in theory at least, connecting the SSD to a multiphy would only lose you 50mb/s at most, at least on slower drives like the 660p which I already think is plenty fast enough
Sep 24 10:54:03 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> The biggest hit would actually be wifi because you'd be stuck with SDIO modules rather than PCIe
Sep 24 10:54:23 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <@Segfault> I'm not exhausting the cache lol
Sep 24 10:55:15 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Thanos the tank engine> so yeah there's a tradeoff
Sep 24 10:55:32 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Absolutely, but I also don't particularly care about wifi performance as long as it's faster than my internet connection so in this theoretical world I don't care about the small performance loss from a setup like that
Sep 24 10:55:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Even the PBPs current WiFi module is adequate for me
Sep 24 10:56:20 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> So yes in this theoretical world I don't actually lose any significant SSD or wifi performance
Sep 24 10:56:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Thanos the tank engine> splitting t5he 4 lanes from the pcie3.0 into 2 sets of 2 lanes could be fun for putting 2 SSDs in RAID
Sep 24 10:56:43 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> If the controller supports it
Sep 24 10:57:04 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> only four lanes is pretty limiting though :(
Sep 24 10:57:14 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Four lanes is quite a bit at 3.0 speeds
Sep 24 10:57:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> 32gbit/s
Sep 24 10:57:31 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Thanos the tank engine> two drives in a raid1 could be faster than one drive with the full bandwidth
Sep 24 10:57:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I'd be surprised if the interconnect rockchip designs will be able to handle that much tbh
Sep 24 10:58:32 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Thanos the tank engine> in a raid0 you'd get fdaster everything but no redundancy
Sep 24 10:58:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Thanos the tank engine> raid1 would have the redundancy benefits at least
Sep 24 10:58:58 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> We can only hope rockchip sees this as an opportunity to create a future proof design (like with the 32gb ram limit) so they iron out the bottlenecks before they can become a problem in the next generation
Sep 24 10:59:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> can a PCIE 3.0 lane be bifurcated into two PCIE 2.0 lanes?
Sep 24 11:00:06 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> It wouldn't be 2.0 lanes
Sep 24 11:00:26 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> If it can it would be splitting it into two 3.0 2x lanes yeah
Sep 24 11:00:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Or possibly even something like one 3.0 1x and one 3.0 3x
Sep 24 11:00:53 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> iirc there's technically nothing stopping PCIe from working with odd numbers of lanes
Sep 24 11:01:25 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Non standard of course
Sep 24 11:01:34 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> But theoretically I think they can work
Sep 24 11:01:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I'm pretty sure there's also at least one 32x implementation
Sep 24 11:02:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Bah that's semantics :P
Sep 24 11:03:18 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> ah right, I thought 3.0 was double 2.0 but that's only true of 4.0 and above
Sep 24 11:03:28 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> No 3.0 is double 2.0
Sep 24 11:03:31 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Just as 2.0 is double 1.0
Sep 24 11:03:45 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> negatory, 2.0 is 5 GT/s, 3.0 is 8 GT/s
Sep 24 11:03:54 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Almost double :P
Sep 24 11:04:18 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> iirc the real world numbers for 2.0 are actually 4gt/s
Sep 24 11:04:36 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> yeah, I was just wondering if it was possible to reconfigure a PCI-E 3.0 port with 4 lanes into a PCI-E 2.0 port with 8 lanes essentially
Sep 24 11:04:38 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> And for 3.0 they're like 7.8gt/s or something
Sep 24 11:04:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Yeah no
Sep 24 11:04:53 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> yep, that's what I thought
Sep 24 11:04:58 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> ah well :-)
Sep 24 11:05:05 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Part of how 3.0 got extra speed was reducing error correction btw
Sep 24 11:05:27 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Those 5/8 numbers are theoretical numbers before encoding yeah
Sep 24 11:06:02 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I'm fairly certain it's before
Sep 24 11:06:13 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Because PCIe 2.0 x1 is 500MB/s real world
Sep 24 11:06:24 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Which is 4GT/s
Sep 24 11:06:26 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Not 5
Sep 24 11:08:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Oh weird
Sep 24 11:09:32 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> well, we're dreaming - take the Framework approach and turn the PCI-E interface into a modular component that you can switch out to a M.2 port or a Thunderbolt port as you wish :P
Sep 24 11:11:26 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Oh also talking about thunderbolt again, I've got more uses for it than just egpus so for someone like me a TB mod for the pbp could actually be insanely useful
Sep 24 11:11:26 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Note how I say mod, because for 99% of people it wouldn't make sense, I just happen to be the 1% of people crazy enough that something like that might just work :P
Sep 24 11:13:52 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> @Segfault I'll take the bait, what do you use TB for?
Sep 24 11:14:22 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Well, GPUs, high speed networking and storage, and other small things that involve PCIe
Sep 24 11:14:23 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> they mentioned other uses
Sep 24 11:15:22 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Oh the experiments I could run if I could plug a box into my PBP with a PCIe slot in it
Sep 24 11:16:16 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I've got the box :)
Sep 24 11:16:17 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/463285150898192384/890995058545917992/unknown.jpeg
Sep 24 11:16:43 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Electr0Lyte> he's got a box
Sep 24 11:16:54 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Yeah but it's nowhere near as convenient having a whole separate machine to my laptop to connect things like that to
Sep 24 11:17:46 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> what's the 3x PCIe 2.0 used for if you don't use the SATA port?
Sep 24 11:18:03 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> On the RK3588?
Sep 24 11:18:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> yup
Sep 24 11:18:18 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I think only two of the multiphys will have PCIe
Sep 24 11:18:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> So it's actually 2x PCIe 2.0 x1 I'm pretty sure
Sep 24 11:18:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Theoretically one would be used for an m.2 E key slot so you can use a pcie wifi module
Sep 24 11:19:10 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> The other one... beats me...
Sep 24 11:19:16 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
Sep 24 11:19:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> That 3x PCIe 2.0 comes from a cnx article which I'm pretty sure is riddled with errors
Sep 24 11:20:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I think they mistook 3 multiphys as 3 PCIe 2.0 controllers
Sep 24 11:20:42 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I'd imagine the rk3588 will probably have a multiphy layout similar to the RK3568
Sep 24 11:21:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> At least one of the controllers should be configured the same way it is on the quartz, so SATA/PCIe
Sep 24 11:21:56 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> And I think one will be configured for USB 3.0/SATA
Sep 24 11:22:05 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> But I'm not sure on that
Sep 24 11:22:16 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> And I don't know what the 3rd one is configured as
Sep 24 11:22:24 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Again, check the RK3568 specs
Sep 24 11:22:50 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Nono I think it's 2 separate pcie 2.0 x1 links assuming all multiphys that can be used for PCIe are
Sep 24 11:23:02 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> https://eji4evk5kxx.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/RK3588-Rockchip-Developer-Conference-2020.jpg
Sep 24 11:23:29 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> I believe that says, exactly, "three lanes PCI-e 2.0/SATA 3.0"
Sep 24 11:23:32 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> make of that what you will
Sep 24 11:25:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> also while researching this, I saw this, and that seems like tough pricing to make
Sep 24 11:25:31 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/463285150898192384/890997380881711154/unknown.png
Sep 24 11:25:33 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> time will tell I suppose
Sep 24 11:26:39 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Maybe see if they had a similar slide for the RK3568? Since that's actually been released we could compare what they said to what we got
Sep 24 11:28:46 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Ignore the pcie 3.0 controller in that diagram btw, that's specific to the RK3568, sort of like the 3.0 x4 controller in the 3588
Sep 24 11:29:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> yep I think that image is from the same conference (Rockchip DC 2020)
Sep 24 11:29:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> it's September 2021, where did the time go? :-)
Sep 24 11:29:21 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> That sounds hopeful for the 3588 3.0 controller doing the same then
Sep 24 11:30:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/463285150898192384/890998679845085244/unknown.jpeg
Sep 24 11:30:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> That's the 3568
Sep 24 11:30:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Those muxes are the multiphys
Sep 24 11:31:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I would imagine the 3588 will be laid out the same way
Sep 24 11:31:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Although maybe not because that only has a single pcie 2.0 controller
Sep 24 11:32:13 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Maybe mux0 on the rk3588 will also have another pcie2.0 controller or something
Sep 24 11:32:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> And iirc compared to that image the 3566 deleted the qsgmii controller and mux0
Sep 24 11:32:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> As well as the PCIe 3.0 contriller
Sep 24 11:43:13 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Potentially?
Sep 24 11:43:28 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I think it can do at least three although idk how qsgmii works
Sep 24 11:44:51 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Oh I see
Sep 24 11:44:54 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Interesting
Sep 24 11:45:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> So yeah I guess the RK3568 can run 6 Ethernet ports directly with the right hardware
Sep 24 11:45:38 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Why not both :P
Sep 24 11:45:47 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Wouldn't qsgmii give you better performance?
Sep 24 11:46:04 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Because you've got a direct link to every port
Sep 24 11:46:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Does increasing packet size markedly decrease CPU use?
Sep 24 11:47:49 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I wonder if the CPU would be powerful enough to route the theoretical what 12gbit/s of 9000mtu packets you could do with that many Ethernet ports lol
Sep 24 11:48:25 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> That is a **lot** of packets lol
Sep 24 11:48:54 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Although for applications where maximum performance isn't needed it might be a good idea anyway because it gives you better firewalling ability and such
Sep 24 11:50:39 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> It's crazy how Rockchip finds new ways to make their chips so versatile lol
Sep 24 11:51:00 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I mean the RK3568 could do so many things, it could be a high end router one minute and a NAS the next
Sep 24 11:51:17 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Or even a phone! :P
Sep 24 11:52:04 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I mean hell this generation they were like "hmm this chip doesn't do enough stuff, let's just let it *modify itself on the fly*" with muxes :P
Sep 24 16:18:47 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> android: strange chats go into the offtopic channel
Sep 25 13:10:24 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <saifage> PINEPHONE will ship to India in future?
Sep 25 13:12:04 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> @Avamander could you add the general Pine64 chat and the lts-and-sopine channel to your Matrix space? And maybe one or two of the admins
Sep 25 13:12:38 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> saifage: not as of now. Pine tried it but there have been severe issues with the customs, from how I've understood it
Sep 25 13:17:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Avamander> Provide the full channel address
Sep 25 13:18:45 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> https://riot.im/app/#/room/#pine64:matrix.org (#pine64:matrix.org) and https://riot.im/app/#/room/#pine64sopine:matrix.org (#pine64sopine:matrix.org), see https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/Main_Page#Chat_Platforms. Thankks, @Avamander
Sep 25 13:21:43 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Avamander> Done
Sep 25 13:21:51 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> üëç
Sep 25 14:10:51 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Thanos the tank engine> Yeah, I have been told that indian customs made it practically impossible for Pine to send anything there
Sep 25 14:11:41 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Thanos the tank engine> So your only option is a mail forwarding service right bow
Sep 25 14:59:54 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <_deepfire> There used to be an #accessories channel -- and it's now no more..
Sep 25 15:00:51 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <_deepfire> ..and it's still weirdly listed in #information-and-rules : -)
Sep 25 16:34:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <willwelker> Is three a chat specifically for the Pinephone?  Was wondering about anybody with AT&T usage.
Sep 25 16:34:17 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <UniversalSuperBox> @pinephone
Sep 25 16:34:33 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <willwelker> Thanks (re @UniversalSuperBox: @pinephone)

Sep 25 20:21:07 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <pinaperr> hey, i received a pinephone a couple of months ago and only yesterday i had the opportunity to try it. at first it ran ok, although i did see some error message on booting. now though the screen is turned off every second, sometimes when i touch it and sometimes just by itself. totally unusable. i'm running the default os (manjaro) and i did play with the screen settings, but this behaviors doesn't make any sense.

Sep 26 03:00:34 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Electr0Lyte> sorry server is meant for discussing Pine64 devices
Sep 26 03:00:36 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <gamiee> PINE64 doesn't have any devices with amlogic SoCs, so this is not correct place, although, you can try to ask in #offtopic and maybe someone will help you

Sep 27 01:47:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <mbohun> pinaperr: same over here, i got my PinePhone in the end of June 2021. The manjaro + plasma-mobile installed on it are not for everyday use. Plus the modem was dying often even after 2 hours, etc.
Sep 27 01:47:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <mbohun> HOWEVER then I installed postmarketOS phosh (the edge version) - and now I always smile, works really good
Sep 27 10:48:41 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> @Philpax that and how Pine links then. IRC has a server linked, Discord has an invite link public and Matrix and Telegram both link individual channels, both also have a spam issue here

Sep 27 22:00:33 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Caleb Christopher Fontenot> I use #offtopic and #pinephone so often I forgot there was a general channel lol
Sep 28 00:07:00 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> The general chat is new. Like a week old @CCF_100
Sep 28 00:08:23 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> @Mk see https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/PinePhone_Software_Releases#Ubuntu_Touch
Sep 28 00:23:50 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <Strit> In matrix the topic for this channel reads: "General discussion for the Pine64 Chat Network. Product-specific questions and discussion and better suited to other chats."
Sep 28 00:27:03 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> Yeah, but new folks will ask specific product questions here anyway. That is something to life with, IMO.
Sep 28 00:30:42 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> Its also laziness. Ask in the first channel you can find. Same like people asking things you have to look up yourself just to get the link, what the asking persons could have done themselves.
Sep 28 02:19:47 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <Ben Finney> I asked questions about "free-software open-design alternative to FitBit, where the user has full control over their own data"
Sep 28 02:20:13 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <Ben Finney> and was led to the PineTime. It does a lot more than I'd need from such a device but seems to have the right sensors and connectivity.
Sep 28 02:21:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <Ben Finney> How well does it make the data avilable? Are there standard "show me data from my wearable" apps for GNU+Linux, and for LineageOS, which work with this?
Sep 28 02:38:12 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <gamiee> Hi Ben Finney, I recommend you to join PineTime Matrix channel, you can find link on our wiki page https://wiki.pine64.org/ :)
Sep 28 11:53:49 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fervi> I think there is a bug with pine64 website. You have one (old version) of website without www and newest with www.
Sep 28 11:58:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <gamiee> what? :o
Sep 28 11:59:02 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <UniversalSuperBox> https://pine64.org should redirect to https://www.pine64.org. It does for me...
Sep 28 12:05:22 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Julian Zb.> I tried it too - works for me
Sep 28 12:06:26 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Julian Zb.> There is also https://pine64.com/, which I am pretty sure is a different site intentionally
Sep 28 12:13:01 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> @fervi test again with pressing control+F5 to reload your local cache
Sep 28 12:14:16 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fervi> @Funeral Maybe the bug is, cause I get a website to old version

Sep 28 12:14:45 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fervi> sorry - anyway, it should be removed or just merged
Sep 28 12:14:49 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> That's the shop, which is a different site and a different organization behind it
Sep 28 12:15:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fervi> ok, but if you then click on "Home button", the redirect wont work
Sep 28 12:15:26 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> The store has more issues than that üòõ
Sep 28 12:15:33 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fervi> ok üòõ

Sep 28 12:28:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fervi> But is the shop open source?
Sep 28 12:28:52 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> You mean the shop software? üòÑ
Sep 28 12:28:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fervi> yep
Sep 28 12:29:06 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fervi> Maybe I should add some bugs

Sep 28 13:00:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <Magnus> im on the defoult that came with the phone how can i check to make sure?
Sep 28 13:01:13 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <Strit> I would suggest updating via terminal/pacman instead of discover.
Sep 28 13:01:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <Strit> Discover has issues with pacman 6 / packagekit for some reason.
Sep 28 13:02:02 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <Magnus> okay thx

Sep 28 14:26:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <Strit> I would have thought Arch would be using Lima like the rest of us on mainline kernel.
Sep 28 14:34:12 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <errquilibria> I found the wayland driver from sunxi50i-a64 support site is the smoothest and supporting graphic acceleration, not that it's a large device but I get about 28 fps in 720p resolution
Sep 28 14:35:10 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <errquilibria> Yeah it picked the llvm automatically (re @p64protocolbot: [D] <gamiee> uuuuh llvmpipe)
Sep 28 14:35:54 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <errquilibria> How does Lima differ from llvm
Sep 28 14:36:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <Strit> Lima is a hardware driver, where llvm is a software driver I believe.
Sep 28 14:36:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <Strit> So llvm will use the CPU instead of the GPU.
Sep 28 14:38:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <errquilibria> Oh OK, I'll look into that, wayland is a kernel driver though but I'll see if there is Lima support on this mali-400 etc hardware (re @p64protocolbot: [M] <Strit> Lima is a hardware driver, where llvm is a software driver I believe.)
Sep 28 14:39:16 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <Strit> You can check in your kernel with `zgrep LIMA /proc/config.gz`.
Sep 28 14:39:25 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <errquilibria> Ah yes, I understand, interesting stuff (re @p64protocolbot: [M] <Strit> So llvm will use the CPU instead of the GPU.)
Sep 28 14:40:39 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <errquilibria> I'll have a look yes thx for the info, it's bit late by me, almost 10 pm so will see tomorrow (re @p64protocolbot: [M] <Strit> You can check in your kernel with `zgrep LIMA /proc/config.gz`.)
Sep 28 14:41:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <errquilibria> I'll look @ arch wiki solong tho

Sep 29 17:17:53 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <SteelCaptain üá∑üá¥ ‚©© [ milsugi ] [ miolingi ]> Doesnt discord have a web client
Sep 29 17:20:24 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <5SpeedFatty> yes but the useragent on the pinephone is setup to make it think you are on android, which blocks that part of the site form access
Sep 29 17:20:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <5SpeedFatty> im sure i could fake it but the thought was see what teh community uses before i go poking

Sep 29 17:27:12 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <SteelCaptain üá∑üá¥ ‚©© [ milsugi ] [ miolingi ]> Im sure its possible in both firefox and chrom*um
Sep 29 17:27:28 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <5SpeedFatty> so far havent installed firefox
Sep 29 17:27:41 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <5SpeedFatty> was checking it out on "anglefish"
Sep 29 17:28:56 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <SteelCaptain üá∑üá¥ ‚©© [ milsugi ] [ miolingi ]> It looks more mobile friendly
Sep 29 17:29:15 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <SteelCaptain üá∑üá¥ ‚©© [ milsugi ] [ miolingi ]> I dont own a pinephone
Sep 29 17:29:53 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <SteelCaptain üá∑üá¥ ‚©© [ milsugi ] [ miolingi ]> But you could try firefox too and also falkon
Sep 29 17:29:54 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <5SpeedFatty> yea i just got mine and im poking around seeign what the default OS looks like bfore i flash the multi image on it and go looking around
Sep 29 17:31:12 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <SteelCaptain üá∑üá¥ ‚©© [ milsugi ] [ miolingi ]> Im more interested in the smartwatch
Sep 29 17:32:01 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <5SpeedFatty> i messed up and didnt pay for the good shipping on my watch
Sep 29 17:32:05 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <5SpeedFatty> its not here yet
Sep 29 17:32:41 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <SteelCaptain üá∑üá¥ ‚©© [ milsugi ] [ miolingi ]> Shipping is very expensive
Sep 29 17:33:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <SteelCaptain üá∑üá¥ ‚©© [ milsugi ] [ miolingi ]> Ill buy 3 if the shipping costs as much as one
Sep 29 17:33:23 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <5SpeedFatty> yea... still the phone shipped out all of 2 days ago
Sep 29 17:33:47 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <5SpeedFatty> and the better shipping had it here in that time
Sep 29 17:35:58 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <SteelCaptain üá∑üá¥ ‚©© [ milsugi ] [ miolingi ]> Would it be possible to make firefox for desktop have the mobile style of tabs via extensions?

Sep 30 04:09:41 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Krissy Silveropossum> I'd recommend editing the user agent in `about:config`
Sep 30 04:09:41 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Krissy Silveropossum> 
Sep 30 04:09:42 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Krissy Silveropossum> Leave everything the same, but *specifically* replace "Android" with "Linux"
Sep 30 04:09:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Krissy Silveropossum> 
Sep 30 04:09:45 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Krissy Silveropossum> Many websites will stop trying to harass you about android apps but will still present their mobile UIs
Sep 30 04:11:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> Better install an user agent switcher add-on. Sites detect the presence of a mobile phone in different ways, changing the user agent back to desktop will break a large amount of sites.
Sep 30 04:12:10 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Krissy Silveropossum> This does not change the user agent to desktop
Sep 30 04:12:39 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Krissy Silveropossum> The user agent string in this case still contains the word "Mobile", which appears to be what any site I've encountered thus far is relying on
Sep 30 04:12:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Krissy Silveropossum> if not the dimensions of screen, etc.
Sep 30 04:16:31 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <yerbkhan> me and my buddy want to order 2 devices, but there is 1 device limit per order, is it possible to make it 2 cuz we are 2 persons? order is in EU
Sep 30 04:17:04 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Cyastis> have you tried..
Sep 30 04:17:04 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Cyastis> 
Sep 30 04:17:06 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Cyastis> changing privacy.resistFingerprinting to True?
Sep 30 04:17:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Cyastis> Because that'll make the userAgent show Windows NT
Sep 30 04:17:59 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Cyastis> yerbkhan I think you'd have to order them separately unfortunately
Sep 30 04:18:23 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Cyastis> it's a carrier limit, not an arbitrary limit pine64 makes
Sep 30 04:20:45 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <thanos the they/them engine> yeah it's an issue of what they can send in the package, noy who orders it
Sep 30 04:21:49 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> To be fair, for the EU warehouse that doesn't apply, they are holding a stock there. But Pine probably can't or won't make the order process region-specific
Sep 30 04:21:50 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <thanos the they/them engine> wait that actually works? I'd have assumed that they were just using the fact that it's a mobile layout to decide to shill the app
Sep 30 04:22:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Krissy Silveropossum> Based on my experience, they're just looking for the word "Android" in the user a gent
Sep 30 04:22:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Krissy Silveropossum> Based on my experience, they're just looking for the word "Android" in the user agent

Sep 30 04:24:28 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Krissy Silveropossum> also more technically accurate X3
Sep 30 04:25:01 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <thanos the they/them engine> if ti stops the app shilling then it already significantly improves the experience

Oct 22 11:14:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <Acanadianrose> Hi! I'm looking at buying a PinePhone but wondering where you can get apps for it and if there is a list that I can look at?
Oct 22 11:26:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> are you familiar with using linux on a desktop or laptop? it's basically the same process
Oct 22 11:26:28 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> there's not really an "app store" like you find on iOS or android
Oct 22 11:27:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> though most of the interfaces you can use on the pinephone have a sort of "app store" looking thing that is a front end for the linux repositories
Oct 22 11:29:21 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <dobey> depends on which OS you run on it

Oct 22 23:04:10 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> there was actually spam on IRC yesterday. someone pointed a spambot at us through the tor network and blasted this channel with messages from about 100 clients
Oct 22 23:04:17 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> somehow it didn't make it across the bridge. i don't really know why.
Oct 22 23:04:41 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> but normally, yea IRC doesn't really get spam because it's too small of a network
Oct 22 23:05:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> actually... that wasn't public messages wasn't it. it was whispers and DMs just to me and abcde (one of the ops on the IRC network, for those not on it)
Oct 22 23:06:04 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> that would be why it didn't cross the bridge üôÇ
Oct 22 23:07:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> but if you have IRC logs in this channel from about 32 hours ago, you'll see a shit ton of joins and then leaves from users with "real" names
Oct 22 23:08:23 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> the bot master seems to have done it to advertise their turkish dating chat site (i'm not kidding...) in their quit message
Oct 22 23:08:59 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> the bots weren't even spamming anything about that, their flood message was just keyboard mashing
Oct 22 23:09:07 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> whole thing is very confusing
Oct 22 23:10:31 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Danct12> @fireTwoOneNine what was the message? i didn't get it :P
Oct 22 23:10:46 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Danct12> but i see that the irc server seems to do it's job well

Oct 22 23:12:43 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Danct12> @fireTwoOneNine as for joining over VPN or Tor, how about something like authentication over sasl?
Oct 22 23:12:52 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> as for the spam message, it was this
Oct 22 23:12:53 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/463285150898192384/901322257127841822/unknown.png
Oct 22 23:13:06 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Danct12> lolwhat
Oct 22 23:13:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Danct12> is the "byeee" quit message a part of the irc server kicking?
Oct 22 23:14:25 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <FatherlyFox> non-printable characters
Oct 22 23:14:52 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> it's unicode 0xFFFD
Oct 22 23:15:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <FatherlyFox> literal name being 'REPLACEMENT CHARACTER' lol
Oct 22 23:15:47 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> i can only assume it's a text encoding or padding fail
Oct 22 23:16:21 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <FatherlyFox> most likely encoding cause it looks like it was trying to do a line break but failed for some reason
Oct 22 23:17:38 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> that's more of a #pinebook question. but off the top of my head, suspend to RAM is a bit of a weird case where it kinda works and kinda doesn't
Oct 22 23:17:51 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> there will be people in that channel who can answer better than i can
Oct 22 23:18:47 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Danct12> @fireTwoOneNine but yeah, if you want you can setup sasl, so people that already had a nickserv account can login over tor or a vpn
Oct 22 23:19:12 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Danct12> this is what libera chat did and it seems to work
Oct 22 23:19:29 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> i might have to look into that if this becomes a recurring problem
Oct 22 23:20:03 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> higher priority for now is finding a way to stop (or at least slow down) the telegram spam
Oct 22 23:20:34 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> other than just using someone else's bot and hoping it doesn't get taken over maliciously (not an uncommon thing with telegram bots sadly)
Oct 22 23:22:06 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <FatherlyFox> Doesn't Telegram have an option to verify by CAPTCHA or something similar?
Oct 22 23:22:39 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> there are bots that do something like that
Oct 22 23:22:46 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> but it's not a native feature afaik
Oct 22 23:25:00 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <FatherlyFox> ahh ok, digging a little deeper that does seem to be the only option atm; can only hope that they implement a native feature for it ü§û
Oct 22 23:27:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> depends on how crazy we'd want to go
Oct 22 23:28:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> just going off a word blacklist would be fairly effective (the telegram spam is pretty consistent)
Oct 22 23:28:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> but it could backfire if a legit user says the wrong thing
Oct 22 23:30:13 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> hm, that looks like it could be useful. might be an excuse to play with making a telegram bot this weekend üôÇ
Oct 22 23:31:28 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> thanks. looks pretty straightforward to use though
Oct 22 23:33:25 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> though it may still have the problem of the bridge catching a message before this bot could delete
Oct 22 23:33:46 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> especially if the classifier can take a while (i have no idea; basically asking you there üôÇ )
Oct 22 23:34:45 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> i was just wondering the same thing. not sure if matterbridge has such an option. technically we could custom compile with a hardcoded delay, but that's obviously non-ideal
Oct 22 23:35:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> license is the least of my worries there. MIT works just fine for me
Oct 22 23:37:03 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> looks like matterbridge has some delay controls for IRC, but that's it
Oct 22 23:38:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> lmao
Oct 22 23:38:25 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> the matterbridge config is already enough of a nightmare, thanks üôÇ
Oct 22 23:38:51 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> pretty sure we have the biggest deployment of it anywhere
Oct 22 23:41:15 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> i suppose i could expand the bot scope to connect to all the chat platforms and delete on those platforms if necessary
Oct 22 23:41:22 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> i don't know
Oct 22 23:41:58 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> that's true
Oct 22 23:42:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> IRC already gets the short end of that stick
Oct 22 23:42:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> is that an irc 2.0 feature? üôÇ
Oct 22 23:45:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> hell of a race condition to set up there. telegram bots have to get and send messages (or literally any action) over HTTP
Oct 22 23:45:21 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> don't know how often matterbridge polls that either
Oct 22 23:46:32 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> matterbridge does make use of the bot API for talking to telegram, yes
Oct 22 23:48:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> see ya
Oct 23 00:20:23 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <thanos the they/them engine> might also be useful to filter images
Oct 23 00:21:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <thanos the they/them engine> just delete messages that have an image matching the checksum of the damn elon musk twitter screenshots they send
Oct 23 00:21:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <thanos the they/them engine> I haven't checked but they probably do
Oct 23 13:12:56 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <wytrzeszcz> hi

Oct 23 18:26:18 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> we need to watch some videos together
Oct 23 18:26:31 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pfeerick> That was a particularly spammy spam though...
Oct 23 18:27:10 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <PiZZaMartijn> the spammiest spam
Oct 23 19:09:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <pfeerick> Sounds like a perfect use for the rockpro64... mine is running as a NAS with to attached USB hard drives... has been running for nearly three years now 24x7... running docker containers, home assistant, and a few other bits an pieces... only issues I've had are usually self-inflicted ;)

Oct 24 03:50:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <ScrumpyJack> morning GMT
Oct 24 03:52:41 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <ScrumpyJack> what's the preferred way to get the HDMI output to fit a TV screen? disable_overscan in /boot/armbianEnv.txt didn't help.
Oct 24 03:52:42 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <ScrumpyJack> (rockpro64/stock Ubuntu/No X11)
Oct 24 04:11:03 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pfeerick> 2x4TB USB3 Seagate Expansion drives plugged directly into the the rockpro64 for bulk storage. Samsung NVMe on PCIe riser for secondary NAS storage, docker containers, etc. EMMC boot, with Samsung EVO microSD as backup (yet to need). Still have the USB2 and TypeC ports free if I really need to plug anything else in. Poor thing is still running 4.4 kernel from 2018... why fix what ain't broke üòÜ .
Oct 24 04:16:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pfeerick> hm... thought it was the other way around... ok, so it's 2xUSB3 drives plugged into the 2xUSB2 ports, leaving the USB3 and TypeC free.
Oct 24 04:18:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pfeerick> For it's intended purpose (bulk video/music storage) the USB2 ports are more than enough for my needs, with the NVMe drive doing any high speed stuff, since it can basically saturate the ethernet link...
Oct 24 04:19:21 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pfeerick> Yes, although they and the RP64 are both common-powered via a 12v solar battery supply.
Oct 24 04:22:20 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Could also just plug both drives directly into the rockpro through the 3.0 type a and type c ports
Oct 24 04:22:59 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pfeerick> I have a second rockpro64, USB3 hub, and another pair of 4TB drives (they are the offline backups of the two that are in service)... I can always run that up and see what happens.
Oct 24 04:23:21 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pfeerick> That would defeat the "don't fix what ain't broke" adage üòõ
Oct 24 12:11:31 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <ideasquarebased> I thought there are 0 taxes (re @p64protocolbot: [D] <Funeral> They don't live in delaware? üòÑ)

Oct 24 13:24:14 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> You still need to pay import taxes if you import it into the single market, even if it's forwarded via wherever. Otherwise it is tax evasion üòâ
Oct 24 13:24:58 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> For countries like Russia they use forwarding services because customs block the orders otherwise

Oct 24 14:28:02 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <spicyoreo> That would probably  be by email then

Oct 24 15:31:42 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <cooncat44> Customs Duty is a tariff or tax imposed on goods when transported across international borders. ... American Goods Returned (AGR) do not have to be declared, but you must be prepared to prove to U.S. Customs and Border Protection the articles are AGR or pay Customs duty. The Customs Duty Rate is a percentage.

Oct 24 15:51:38 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> that's up to your postal carrier but I assume it's the postal hub they're routing through
Oct 24 15:52:32 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <koala> Hmm, you think my watch will most likely be here this week or next week then?
Oct 24 16:05:12 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Philpax> probably? again, depends on your postal carrier :P

Oct 26 14:55:12 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Porkyofthepine (sxmo btw)> Wait I don't think most guys want their gf to be "free and open source"
Oct 26 15:01:39 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <UniversalSuperBox> please don't
Oct 26 15:05:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> hey lads, do you think the rk3588 will be pin compatible with the 3568?
Oct 26 15:14:03 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> most likely not
Oct 26 15:14:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> i don't exactly have datasheets for the 3588, but it almost certainly has more peripherals, which means it needs more pins
Oct 26 15:19:07 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> :(
Oct 26 15:19:33 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> I wanted to try to get a head start designing something
Oct 26 15:19:54 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> I guess I'll keep waiting for the rk3566 to show up on aliexpress

Oct 26 17:22:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <ayayagames> PLEEEAASSEEE Q4 20201
Oct 26 20:52:23 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <CalcProgrammer1> the real question - which comes first, the steam deck or the pinephone pro?
Oct 26 20:52:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <CalcProgrammer1> Q1 2022 is going to be a good quarter for Linux
Oct 26 21:14:24 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <NULL> steam deck
Oct 26 21:21:45 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Randall> I'm wondering if we'll see people using pinephone pros with keyboard attachments running as input devices for the steam deck
Oct 26 21:35:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <eNos> Do we know the release window for Pinephone Pro Explorer Edition?
Oct 26 21:44:26 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Cyastis> Whenever half life 3 gets released
Oct 26 21:46:18 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <dbcairyyywil> 
Oct 26 21:49:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <eNos> Hmm, I don't remember subscribing to a cryptocurrency channel...
Oct 26 22:27:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <ayayagames> Explorer edition is coming either in the next couple months this year or the start of next year
Oct 26 23:13:20 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <eNos> I saw the Interview about the PPP, so hopefully Luke knew what he was saying when he claimed that Pine had gotten enough inventory to weather the chip shortage and that we don't end up with "where is the PS5" situation.
Oct 27 02:50:07 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <ayayagames> Lmao the ps5
Oct 27 02:50:26 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <ayayagames> nothing will be that bad again

Oct 27 11:46:58 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <romadr> Hello, I plan to use pine64 hardware to validate a new block-chain in a sustainable way with low power devices such as RP64 and coming soon Quartz64. I read  brand and logo guidelines https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/PINE64_brand_and_logo and I was wondering whom to ask. Thanks for your answer.
Oct 27 11:49:14 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> assuming it's non-commercial, i think that it's allowable as "software [that] is compatible with PINE64 hardware"
Oct 27 12:01:34 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Exaeta> As far as trademarks in the US, you can use the term "Pine64" as long as there is no "likelihood of confusion". E.g. you can say "Tested to work with Pine64" but not use Pine64 in the name of the project (generally speaking). The logo might be usable under fair use but it depends on the circumstances.
Oct 27 12:03:36 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Exaeta> For example, it's probably fair use to include the logo in a "compatible with" section, but not on a coffee mug as another example.
Oct 27 12:13:02 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Exaeta> You can contact info@pine64.org if you want to get permission first

Oct 27 13:25:20 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Exaeta> In my country, it's based on "likelihood of confusion".
Oct 27 13:26:53 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Exaeta> Well yes, there is case law for stuff like referencing a product. Which is allowed.

Oct 27 13:33:00 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <Panuozzo77> Hey guys, is there any other thing similar to the Pinebook Pro?
Oct 27 13:33:02 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <Panuozzo77> I mean, a laptop with Arm64 + Linux and not Android
Oct 27 13:33:25 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> Just ask and you're good to go, I don't know why this has to be discussed. The rules were written because of 1-2 people severely misbehaving, while everyone else does not. üòÑ

Oct 27 13:45:31 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Exaeta> we have a channel for offtopic in discord
Oct 27 13:45:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Exaeta> is it not connected?
Oct 27 13:46:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Exaeta> not sure how telegram works
Oct 27 14:12:14 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Exaeta> I have a question, why does pine use SD cards when SD is a proprietary format?
Oct 27 14:12:52 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Exaeta> Shouldn't we use an open format?
Oct 27 14:13:14 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Exaeta> Like, assuming Pine wants to support open source
Oct 27 14:14:18 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <UniversalSuperBox> Do you have an example
Oct 27 14:15:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <UniversalSuperBox> Especially one that would be supported by the hardware the Pine64 uses
Oct 27 14:16:07 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <UniversalSuperBox> Sometimes the truly open solution is not the best, nor is it at all reasonable.
Oct 27 14:17:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <UniversalSuperBox> And a "but not *everything* you use is open" litmus test will only mean that you get to throw away all your computers and stare out the window for the rest of your life
Oct 27 14:17:17 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <Strit> What would be an open alternative to the SD card?
Oct 27 14:17:42 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <Strit> Taking what the SoC's can boot into account.
Oct 27 14:42:27 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> SD has a slower spi mode that's open
Oct 27 14:43:38 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> although who cares because absolutely no interfaces are open anyway
Oct 27 14:44:07 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> although who cares because almost no interfaces are open anyway

Oct 27 18:44:03 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> something might have to
Oct 27 19:02:05 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> no rush, i haven't had time to do anything with it
Oct 27 19:04:24 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> if you want that's fine, but my hexchat has been logging for months üòâ
Oct 27 19:07:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> nope, this one has the most by far
Oct 27 19:08:47 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> i probably ought to mention though that a telegram captcha bot is probably more effective (and easier) than the spam classifier
Oct 27 19:09:00 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> preventive rather than reactive, and means the spam doesn't get to IRC üòâ
Oct 27 19:09:06 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> yes
Oct 27 19:09:22 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> i tried to start one up a few days ago but ran into technical issues
Oct 27 19:10:16 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> technically yes, but bots could still find the invites
Oct 27 19:10:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> we're beyond the point of obscurity being effective
Oct 27 19:11:26 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> standard telegram background noise for groups of our sizes, afaik
Oct 27 19:11:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> would be nice if the telegram devs could fix their own shit, but ya know üôÇ
Oct 27 19:13:34 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <UniversalSuperBox> You'll never get rid of all of the spam on Telegram. But a captcha bot can get rid of a very good portion of it.
Oct 27 19:13:36 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> a bit of column A, a bit of column B. but from what i've read, most of the bots are programmed very lazily
Oct 27 19:13:53 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> the spam bots i mean
Oct 27 19:14:04 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <UniversalSuperBox> Much like you still get a bit of noise in your gmail inbox, even though the scale is way different.
Oct 27 19:15:02 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <UniversalSuperBox> congratulations
Oct 27 19:15:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> the end goal probably will be to have a captcha bot to handle most of the spam, and the classifier bot to clean up the rest
Oct 27 19:17:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> we'd already have the captcha bot, if mongodb actually built for arm64 (outside of niche cases)
Oct 27 19:17:42 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> so i need to go looking for a different bot (because i really don't want to custom compile that for a production server)
Oct 27 19:59:51 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <beingviking> Hi! I‚Äôm living in Korea. If I buy a pinephone ($149.99) now, Would it dispatch late november? I hope I haven‚Äôt been too late.

Oct 28 12:49:26 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> there's nothing special about our websites' source code. the main site and store are wordpress, the forum is mybb, and the wiki is mediawiki
Oct 28 12:49:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> all of those are already open source üôÇ
Oct 28 14:39:59 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <tripLr> Is there a link to the video ?
Oct 28 14:59:42 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> tripLr: which video are you referring to? I think there is some context missing
Oct 28 16:15:45 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <CodingPanic> I think I‚Äôm going to have a pinebook pro, pinephone, and serial cable for sale‚Ä¶
Oct 28 16:16:07 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <CodingPanic> I love my pine power and pinecil, but Havnt quite adjusted to these two
Oct 28 16:16:17 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <CodingPanic> Plus, looking to find a pinenote
Oct 28 18:28:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <cooncat44> Lol
Oct 28 20:39:49 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Exaeta> Any suggestions for discord client for pinephone?
Oct 28 21:16:05 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <ayayagames> there are a few but i forgot
Oct 28 21:16:16 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <ayayagames> and you have to use your token lol
Oct 28 21:16:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <ayayagames> and they will ban you if found out lmao
Oct 28 21:16:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> There was cchat-gtk but I don't think it's being particularly actively developed
Oct 28 21:16:52 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Also yeah custom clients are against TOS
Oct 28 21:17:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> the discord client is just a bunch of JS, has nobody gotten it working on ARM?
Oct 28 21:17:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> also, i think you could run the android version in anbox or something
Oct 28 21:17:59 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <ayayagames> browser works lol
Oct 28 21:18:13 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <ayayagames> anbox is ass lol
Oct 28 21:18:53 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> they collect a *lot* of analytics
Oct 28 21:19:04 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> under the /science url
Oct 28 21:19:10 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Anbox runs really slowly, the official client has some proprietary files in it that I guess nobody has managed to decompile?
Oct 28 21:19:13 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> also they dont like the automation of user accounts
Oct 28 21:19:15 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <ayayagames> waydroid is better from what i hear but i hate IOS and android even thoughi used an iphone 5 till the PP camne out amd have daily drove the pinephone for 2 years now
Oct 28 21:19:29 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Someone made an open source electron wrapper for the website that I've heard works decently but eh
Oct 28 21:19:51 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> the official desktop client just loads the website anyway lmao
Oct 28 21:20:03 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> It does some other special things as well
Oct 28 21:20:36 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> yeah, for stuff like video streaming and detecting background button presses for push to talk
Oct 28 21:21:26 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> hey lads, anyone know when the allwinner t723 will be released

Oct 28 21:23:03 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I can't find much info on it
Oct 28 21:23:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> it's supposedly coming out in 2021
Oct 28 21:23:41 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> but it's 2021 now

Oct 30 00:41:23 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <ArMor> Oh, hi mark
Oct 30 00:41:32 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <ArMor> Strange to see you here
Oct 30 00:41:53 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> oh neat you're in this server too
Oct 30 00:50:46 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I don't think so
Oct 30 00:51:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Maybe have a look at the radxa zero or the banana pi m2 zero
Oct 30 00:51:41 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Is the rockpro64 just like not supported very much? Some of the wiki info seems like it might be outdated the android builds 'boot' at best and I had something I wanted to use it for with an android application and I guess I didn't do enough research before picking one up lol.
Oct 30 00:52:20 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> It should be able to run a regular mainline kernel
Oct 30 00:52:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> @Segfault like roll a version of android with mainline kernel or?
Oct 30 00:53:02 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> In theory most linux distros should "just work" as long as they have an ARM image
Oct 30 00:53:27 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> yeah my main gripe is dual display port (DP over USB-C+HDMI) at the same time
Oct 30 00:53:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> yeah my main gripe is dual display support (DP over USB-C+HDMI) at the same time
Oct 30 00:53:43 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Yeah that's gonna need a custom kernel
Oct 30 00:53:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Like 7.1->8.0->9.0 though...
Oct 30 00:53:50 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Hell even with a custom kernel that barely works at the moment
Oct 30 00:54:02 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> 7.1 worked great, ran great it felt good.
Oct 30 00:54:06 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> no dual display.
Oct 30 00:54:10 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> 8.0 was slow as garbage.
Oct 30 00:54:21 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Pine devices generally don't get very good android support unfortunately, I don't think much of the community is particularly interested in it outside of verifying that the hardware works
Oct 30 00:54:27 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> 9.0 ran but was flashing the screen non-stop, was able to drive DP and HDMI at the same time but mirrored image
Oct 30 00:54:28 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> lol
Oct 30 00:54:33 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I see
Oct 30 00:54:42 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Even the pinephone? lol
Oct 30 00:54:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> There were some efforts for android on the pinephone but I haven't heard anything about them lately
Oct 30 00:55:13 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Heh
Oct 30 00:55:34 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I guess I'll look into rolling my own android support if I continue going down this path.
Oct 30 00:55:52 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> despite dsimic's disagreement
Oct 30 00:57:13 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> When you have software that you want to run and don't 'own' /didn't write yourself or have source to that are only compatible with android other than antbox I don't see much choice.
Oct 30 01:00:31 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Because I need exposed GPIO with at minimum two UART interfaces available, and dual display support.
Oct 30 01:00:59 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> and I don't want to rely on software UART over GPIO or bitbanging either.
Oct 30 01:01:46 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I'm trying to come up with a drop in replacement for another board that's less powerful and runs android/some android applications on it
Oct 30 01:01:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> in order to allow those applications to run at higher resolutions on one of the displays without lagging.
Oct 30 01:02:36 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Current board utilizes an H6 clocking the cortex cores at 1.8ghz
Oct 30 01:02:56 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Ah yes the forgotten H6 :P
Oct 30 01:02:59 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> So I figured the RK3399 might do nicely.
Oct 30 01:03:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> The original board also only has 1gb of RAM.
Oct 30 01:03:22 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> so the RAM upgrade was just a an addition to that and the poor performance.
Oct 30 01:03:45 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> The idea was to fab a PCB adapter to breakout the GPIO into the connectors supported by the original device so it was literally a drop in replacement.
Oct 30 01:04:28 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> but alas without proper android and dual display not gonna have a ton of luck.
Oct 30 01:04:39 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I'm sure I'd get crucified for suggesting it but the RPI 4 could potentially also do the job, not sure if it's got a decent Android image available or not
Oct 30 01:04:42 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I've got a few boards, this was just the first to arrive out of the few I'm looking at.
Oct 30 01:04:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Nah, there's an unofficial port of lineage OS for it afaik
Oct 30 01:05:00 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> and it doesn't work well
Oct 30 01:05:03 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> worse than this infact.
Oct 30 01:05:06 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> :/
Oct 30 01:05:07 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> does the vim3 have android?
Oct 30 01:05:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> could be an option
Oct 30 01:05:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Does it do video over USB-C?
Oct 30 01:05:54 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> It only seems to have a single HDMI port
Oct 30 01:06:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Oh wait it has MIPI-DSI, good luck getting that working though
Oct 30 01:06:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> haha
Oct 30 01:07:14 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I mean, initially I was crazy enough to think I'd find a board with LVDS on it...
Oct 30 01:07:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Well the rockpro has eDP
Oct 30 01:08:05 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I'm not entirely sure how you'd *use* it, in Linux it's probably just a dts edit, in Android... ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Oct 30 01:08:13 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> edp is basically the same as dp
Oct 30 01:08:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Yea, I also wouldn't know how to go from eDP to LVDS (Only had luck finding adapters to do the opposite)
Oct 30 01:09:36 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> ah I know how to do that actually
Oct 30 01:09:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> ptn3460
Oct 30 01:09:54 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Actually wow the rockpro has 4 display outputs, DSI, eDP, HDMI and USB-C
Oct 30 01:09:56 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> used one in my diy'd laptop
Oct 30 01:10:00 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Can only do two at once though :(
Oct 30 01:11:22 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Would require making an adapter lol.... I don't know PCB design very well will be the first time trying to build such an adapter and that would complicate what I'd have to do heavily.
Oct 30 01:11:43 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I only need two at once lol üò¶
Oct 30 01:11:56 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Does the armbian build support USB-C -> DP and HDMI at the same time?
Oct 30 01:13:12 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I don't know much about what would cause it not to work kernel wise, so I'm probably in over my head if I did go down the route of trying to add the support for it in android... but what actually causes it not to work? You mentioned custom kernel; I imagine drivers?
Oct 30 01:14:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> it's out of stock but this is what I have
Oct 30 01:14:45 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Crafty> https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32835211459.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.27424c4d3IPJco
Oct 30 01:14:59 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Electr0Lyte> same dts but it has its own partition
Oct 30 01:15:10 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Electr0Lyte> dtbo i think ?
Oct 30 01:15:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> dtbos aren't really a thing outside of the rpi
Oct 30 01:15:59 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> That listing title is so confusing lol, says it does the opposite shows on the board it doing what "we" would want, and then in the description says it the proper way.
Oct 30 01:17:27 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> calling it a "driver board" looks like there's a good amount of listings though; https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001369234799.html
Oct 30 01:18:45 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Also I'm not sure what cable you need for eDP on the rockpro
Oct 30 01:19:39 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I don't even know if there's a standard for the mainboard side of eDP cables
Oct 30 01:19:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Well I still don't know if using eDP over the USB-C->DP would solve my problem of wanting two displays anyway.
Oct 30 01:19:45 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> lol
Oct 30 01:20:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> At this point what I wanted to do probably isn't worth the effort if I'm being honest, at least not based on the lack of performance increase I saw running the software on the rockpro
Oct 30 01:20:45 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Getting an install with reliably working DP alt mode will need you to use the BSP kernel most likely
Oct 30 01:20:59 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Unless that was more related to the android drivers/support than it was the hardware itself.
Oct 30 01:21:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Another thing I'd noticed, 9.0 made my CPU fan not spin
Oct 30 01:21:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> lol
Oct 30 01:21:12 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> maybe bad DTS.
Oct 30 01:22:24 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I just thought maybe the rockpro64 wasn't well supported considering it doesn't seem like it's talked about much, and I assume rock64 is another board as far as channels in here.
Oct 30 01:22:38 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> saw the #quartz64 was the 'newer' board but seems to have weaker hardware?
Oct 30 01:22:43 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> correct me if I'm worng.
Oct 30 01:22:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> *wrong
Oct 30 01:23:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> eDP cabling is pretty much standardized
Oct 30 01:23:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> there's "30 pin" and "40 pin" cables
Oct 30 01:23:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Yeah on the display side of things
Oct 30 01:23:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> What about the rockpro itself
Oct 30 01:23:45 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> It's just a flat flex connector
Oct 30 01:24:13 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> i haven't really ever looked at that, but i'm assuming it's the same connector as on the display side
Oct 30 01:24:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Nope
Oct 30 01:25:04 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> eDP cables typically terminate like this on the display side
Oct 30 01:25:05 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/463285150898192384/903892240399736872/unknown.png
Oct 30 01:25:36 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> the rockpro just takes one of these (or something similar)
Oct 30 01:25:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/463285150898192384/903892372084129812/Flat-Flex-Cable.png
Oct 30 01:26:29 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> yea you're right. i forgot about that. went to go look at a spare eDP panel i have sitting around üôÇ
Oct 30 01:27:12 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> it is 30pin on the RP64 though, and i do see straight through adapter cables
Oct 30 01:27:20 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> i would assume that is the right cable
Oct 30 01:27:27 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> it wouldn't be something custom üòâ
Oct 30 01:27:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Someone should try it :)
Oct 30 01:28:20 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> i'd get one of those cables, but that spare display is probably a bit too power hungry (15.6")
Oct 30 01:28:20 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I've got a quartz and an eDP panel somewhere, if noone's tried it by the time video output works on the quartz I'll buy a cable and give it a go
Oct 30 01:28:50 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I'll have a look at the schematic, maybe see what regulator is powering that connector
Oct 30 01:29:14 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> (I'm doing a lot of schematic checking today lol)
Oct 30 01:29:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> if 15.6" is too power hungry in my application it def would not work lol
Oct 30 01:30:00 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> i'm guessing there. i'm just concerned about the backlight power consumption
Oct 30 01:30:18 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> need to check schematic for RP and datasheet for a given panel
Oct 30 01:30:20 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Most large signage displays probably use an external power source for the backlight
Oct 30 01:30:53 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> This one is driven directly off the board, given the board gets supplied additional power from a power unit
Oct 30 01:31:20 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> My plan was actually to do something stupid and go USB-C->HDMI (Or DP->HDMI off USB-C) into an LVDS driver board.
Oct 30 01:31:26 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> because the driver board takes an external power source
Oct 30 01:31:27 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> It seems like on the rockpro the edp port can draw power from VCCA_0V9 and VCC1V8_DVP
Oct 30 01:31:36 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> to feed the needed power into the display
Oct 30 01:32:07 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Oh wait it seems like backlight power comes from EDPAUXP
Oct 30 01:32:21 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> i'm pretty sure display backlights run off a beefier rail than 1v8...
Oct 30 01:32:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Which from what I can tell draws from VCC3V3_S0
Oct 30 01:33:16 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> This seems to be the eDP connector on the rockpro
Oct 30 01:33:16 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/463285150898192384/903894303930195988/unknown.png
Oct 30 01:33:47 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Apparently VCC3V3_S0 comes from the RK808
Oct 30 01:33:47 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> oh ok, that backlight rail is straight from 12V Vcc
Oct 30 01:33:54 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Wait 12V?
Oct 30 01:33:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> that's all i was really worried about
Oct 30 01:33:58 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Oh yeah there it is lol
Oct 30 01:34:22 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> so as long as your power brick is up to the task, should be a non-issue
Oct 30 01:34:24 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Yep
Oct 30 01:34:33 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I'd imagine most panels don't draw more than 5W or so
Oct 30 01:34:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> 12v is what's being driven into this LVDS display I'm referring to
Oct 30 01:34:56 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I think it has two separate 12v inputs though
Oct 30 01:35:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I doubt the LVDS connector itself is rated for whatever crazy wattage those big signage panels use if that's what you're talking about
Oct 30 01:35:54 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> dsimic: bah that's yet another reason the next PBP should use a 2s battery config
Oct 30 01:36:38 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> a big commercial sign panel is definitely not getting powered via LVDS
Oct 30 01:36:50 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> at least not the main drive power. there may be logic power via that
Oct 30 01:37:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> @fireTwoOneNine what were those generic cables you were talking about?
Oct 30 01:38:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> i just found them on aliexp https://www.aliexpress.com/i/32756336009.html
Oct 30 01:38:34 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> LOL
Oct 30 01:38:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/463285150898192384/903895636464762910/unknown.png
Oct 30 01:39:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Well you're right in that they seem to be a direct pass through, I wonder what the pinout of the eDP connector itself is
Oct 30 01:39:39 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/463285150898192384/903895907353903124/iu.png
Oct 30 01:39:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Excuse my ignorance but when is the rk sd tool used? For most of these things I've just been using etcher.
Oct 30 01:40:03 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> are there actually cases where you'd want/need that sd tool
Oct 30 01:40:03 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> you don't need to worry about that tool
Oct 30 01:40:13 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Yeah sure enough that pinout looks like a match
Oct 30 01:40:17 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> all the images we have are made to be directly flashed to SD or eMMC
Oct 30 01:40:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Niiice so those generic cables should work great then
Oct 30 01:41:12 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I like how you both just went down an eDP rabbit hole out of curiosity of how it's used lol.
Oct 30 01:41:21 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> or implemented rather.
Oct 30 01:41:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> It's good to know these things :P
Oct 30 01:41:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I'm not judging
Oct 30 01:41:52 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> The amount of crap I know about android I didn't a month ago is beyond what I wanted to ever know about it...
Oct 30 01:41:58 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> because 'it's good to know these things'
Oct 30 01:42:00 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> lol
Oct 30 01:42:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I'm more of a software guy than hardware though.
Oct 30 01:42:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> i jumped into this conversation late and didn't read the context until later üòõ
Oct 30 01:42:33 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Actually fire you might find some of the scrollback in #pinebook somewhat interesting, we discovered why the main-daughterboard cable in the PBP is so damn wide
Oct 30 01:43:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> So again, excuse my ignorance but, is fire not one of the people who designed some of this stuff?
Oct 30 01:43:23 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I think they were mostly designed externally
Oct 30 01:43:59 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> afraid i'm not. i'm pretty knowledgeable on a lot of the hardware (and designing new hardware), but for P64 i'm basically just a sysadmin
Oct 30 01:44:07 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Also I must say, trying to get one of these running for the first time... was nerve racking.
Oct 30 01:44:22 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I don't have an emmc module yet; and the wiki is basically 'if your lights blink it works'
Oct 30 01:44:23 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> lol
Oct 30 01:44:29 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> so I plug an sd card in with an android image
Oct 30 01:44:43 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> have no idea how to establish UART except that the wiki tells you not to do it prior to U-Boot SPL
Oct 30 01:44:47 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> for the rockchip
Oct 30 01:44:51 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> so had no idea what was going wrong
Oct 30 01:44:56 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> or the fact I had to push a power button
Oct 30 01:44:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> lol
Oct 30 01:45:12 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Huh I thought the rockpro powered on as soon as it got power, the quartz definitely does
Oct 30 01:45:27 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> the rp64 definitely powers on when it gets plugged in
Oct 30 01:45:33 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> There's power for sure, the ethernet starts lighting up; but I've had to hit the power button
Oct 30 01:45:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> every time I've loaded a new image
Oct 30 01:45:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> but the android images may be weird, idk
Oct 30 01:45:52 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> This was on armbian too
Oct 30 01:45:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Oct 30 01:45:58 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> when android wasn't working I went with armbian
Oct 30 01:46:28 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Nothing happened till I hit power button, then fan started spinning and I was excited/enamored because I didn't get a brick lol
Oct 30 01:46:43 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Then somewhat impatiently waited for HDMI to come up
Oct 30 01:47:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> saw the armbian login screen
Oct 30 01:47:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> actually maybe RP does need you to press the power button. it's been a while since i used mine üòí
Oct 30 01:47:16 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> and went back to the android builds
Oct 30 01:47:53 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> anyway, the docs around the android builds are probably sparse and archaic -- they were mostly just test images when the device was brand new
Oct 30 01:48:04 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> very few people use them
Oct 30 01:48:12 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I've realized as much haha.
Oct 30 01:49:03 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> doesn't even auto-resize the partitions lol
Oct 30 01:49:04 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/463285150898192384/903898272345759754/unknown.png
Oct 30 01:49:05 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> The unfortunate thing is I was skeptical about other boards because their android support was advertised as pretty much being 'unofficial' saw the pine wiki and was like wow there's a lot here, this must be an actively supported board and they have android builds
Oct 30 01:49:14 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> and the wiki was well organized
Oct 30 01:49:36 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> deceiving bastards with your organized stuff lol
Oct 30 01:49:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> you're in a tiny minority needing android on an SBC üòâ
Oct 30 01:49:52 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I know üò¶
Oct 30 01:50:04 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> If I had a choice it wouldn't be android lol.
Oct 30 01:51:14 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> if those old test android images don't work out for you, you honestly might be better off running waydroid on linux lmao
Oct 30 01:51:25 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> :reeee:
Oct 30 01:51:26 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> never heard of waydroid
Oct 30 01:51:29 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> is there performance impact?
Oct 30 01:51:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Anbox but less crap performance
Oct 30 01:51:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> ^ that
Oct 30 01:51:45 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> The complication would be dual display
Oct 30 01:51:58 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I'm not sure how performance compares to native
Oct 30 01:52:17 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Also USB-C support on mainline linux is "a bit dodgy" at the moment
Oct 30 01:52:21 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> waydroid supposedly works pretty damn well on the pinephone pro, which is also RK3399 (downclocked from RP64, even)
Oct 30 01:52:32 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> PPP is also running a single display at 720p
Oct 30 01:52:38 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> lame
Oct 30 01:52:55 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <fireTwoOneNine> the problem with waydroid if anything would be CPU not GPU
Oct 30 01:53:11 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> The SBC world is weird right now.
Oct 30 01:53:12 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> It might work on a BSP kernel but don't even ask me how you'd get the blob Mali driver working
Oct 30 01:53:22 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> You go either pi4/pine or some dev board
Oct 30 01:53:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> or some really weird chineese board supported by one guy
Oct 30 01:53:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> who posts a ton of random source on github
Oct 30 01:53:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> and hope it can compile
Oct 30 01:53:38 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> lol
Oct 30 01:54:06 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> That's personal experience thus far
Oct 30 01:54:10 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Things have improved a lot lately but yeah it's still a bit archaic, especially if you can't deal with missing certain features like USB-C alt mode
Oct 30 01:54:32 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Well even if USB-C isn't there if I can go eDP to LVDS and still draw enough power for it to work.
Oct 30 01:54:34 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> fwiw USB alt mode *does* work on mainline, it's just very unreliable, probably not ideal for signage lol
Oct 30 01:54:46 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> This isn't signage, but yeah..
Oct 30 01:54:47 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> lol
Oct 30 01:55:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Yep eDP to LVDS would probably work well, the main problem then would just be reliability of waydroid and whether it performs well enough
Oct 30 01:55:13 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> So to give an idea of what this is; it's a virtual pinball machine.
Oct 30 01:55:15 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> RK3399 is quick but it's not magic
Oct 30 01:55:34 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> and the reason for two displays is the "DMD (Dot Matrix Display)" despite it being an actual monitor in this case.
Oct 30 01:55:40 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> where the game renders to a 'presentation api' in android
Oct 30 01:55:46 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> to put that onto that second screen
Oct 30 01:55:54 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Huh that's pretty cool
Oct 30 01:56:07 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> the main screen is the play area where you see the 'play field' and the ball moving around and such
Oct 30 01:56:21 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Actually I wonder if the eDP output would work with Android
Oct 30 01:56:24 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> They shipped them with 720p, and 1080p runs fine on a lot of it except this one that emulates actual pinball roms
Oct 30 01:56:31 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> so I'm guessing heavier compute involved.
Oct 30 01:56:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Specifically the Android 7 image you said performed fine
Oct 30 01:56:49 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> it seemed like it did, or better than the rest.
Oct 30 01:56:53 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> HDMI seemed more functional
Oct 30 01:57:02 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> and my CPU fan worked
Oct 30 01:57:02 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> lol
Oct 30 01:57:04 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Yeah now I'm curious if eDP would work with that image
Oct 30 01:58:02 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Yeah, so; in some cases some people replace their display with non LVDS ones
Oct 30 01:58:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> dsimic: Yeah no rush on this, it's more of an experiment than anything.
Oct 30 01:58:31 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I just wanted to see if things -could- run better.
Oct 30 01:58:58 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> These pinball things shipped with 1080p displays but drove 720p at software level
Oct 30 01:59:07 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Everyone's eagerly awaiting dp alt mode being fixed lol
Oct 30 01:59:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Oh I meant than the stock PCB.
Oct 30 01:59:10 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> heh.
Oct 30 01:59:47 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I have no idea, I've just started using it tonight.
Oct 30 01:59:50 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I think it stays powered down
Oct 30 01:59:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> but I'm using the button to turn it off.
Oct 30 02:00:30 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Segfault some other cool things about these virtual pinball things is that they have feedback mechanisms via push solenoids.
Oct 30 02:00:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> That's why the 2 UART interfaces are necessary
Oct 30 02:00:46 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> one accepts input the other gets written to for the feedback mechanism to be fired.
Oct 30 02:00:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Oh I see
Oct 30 02:00:49 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> when bumpers/slingshots are hit.
Oct 30 02:01:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> I'd have expected things like that to use I2C
Oct 30 02:01:16 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> There's a gyro hooked to i2c
Oct 30 02:01:18 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> but that's about it
Oct 30 02:01:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I don't know that I've 'discovered' any issues lol.
Oct 30 02:01:50 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I tried to run android, and was told android doesn't work üòõ
Oct 30 02:02:02 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I imagine a lot of those 'problems' are isolated to android itself
Oct 30 02:02:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> or the kernels being used in those builds
Oct 30 02:02:47 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> If the program you were running was able to work on Linux I'd say run BSP Debian, that way dp alt mode works perfectly
Oct 30 02:02:50 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Yeah, I'm not complaining about it just saying that I don't really expect those issues to be fixed lol.
Oct 30 02:03:06 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> I'm gonna try waydroid on armbian
Oct 30 02:03:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> The waydroid part should work, I think it's a mainline kernel so dp alt mode may or may not
Oct 30 02:03:46 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> As for performance in waydroid... ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Oct 30 02:04:21 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Like I said this is more curiosity at the moment than anything.
Oct 30 02:04:34 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Segfault> Can't hurt to try
Oct 30 02:04:43 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> If it worked and did things better than what was there, was going to open source a PCB design that had the stock IDC connector/JST from the system converted to the GPIO
Oct 30 02:04:54 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> and make some software to help dump/port the original over to the 'new' board.
Oct 30 02:04:56 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> whatever that may be
Oct 30 02:05:13 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> so it was 'plug and play' for the most part.
Oct 30 02:16:48 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <pnill> Also for clarification Android 9.0 (and whatever kernel it was using) was weird... it actually mirrored the image on both but made the HDMI distorted at the same time (green).

Oct 30 13:36:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Frostclaw20> Hi
Oct 30 13:48:47 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Blockycleric> Hello.
Oct 30 14:18:43 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Synth> It seems that after I updated sxmo, the button bindings have gotten messed up. Anyone have any clue on how to fix this?
Oct 30 14:32:17 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <qnerop> 
Oct 30 14:57:23 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <ayayagames> If it‚Äôs mostly in suspend mode and it should last all day
Oct 30 14:57:35 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <ayayagames> Especially with the keyboard plus battery
Oct 30 15:00:44 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> Jaguar: the pro is not released yet, the first devices ship to the developers in December. So you won't find any numbers. Megi had numbers for the non-S variant of the RK3399 but those numbers are only of limited use
Oct 30 15:00:46 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <Oscar> @Moderator telegram spam
Oct 30 15:02:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> That would be for the best. For now you could only get wrong estimates
Oct 30 15:02:15 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> in both directions
Oct 30 15:04:42 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <ayayagames> The only thing that‚Äôs missing is Bluetooth headphone calling capability
Oct 30 15:05:46 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <ayayagames> Granted I‚Äôve only had a single pair of Mic Bluetooth headphones, And they say it should work but it‚Äôs not it‚Äôs probably a Linux thing or something in the Bluetooth stack but audiobooks and everything else works so I just can‚Äôt pick up a call nor get sound from my headphones via call

Oct 30 16:34:37 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <kunrooted> when will Pinebook Pro be available again?
Oct 30 16:57:08 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Cody> the pinephone convergence package will ship in two shipments, right? i received my pinephone, but not the dock
Oct 30 17:01:29 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> @Cody did you order the 3GB or the 2GB version?
Oct 30 17:01:38 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Cody> 3GB
Oct 30 17:01:54 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Cody> as far as i know, convergence edition is the 3GB pinephone with a usb-c dock
Oct 30 17:02:22 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> The USB-C dock is underneath the plastic shell in which the phone lays on top
Oct 30 17:03:07 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Cody> :LaughLiz: I'm an idiot. Thank you
Oct 30 17:03:14 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> No worries

Oct 31 13:05:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <peac> hi, I have received an email from sales@pine64.org requesting info for the second time and i'm not sure if they receive my emails. Is there someone from the team who could help ?
Oct 31 13:06:47 <P64ProtocolBot>	[M] <Strit> This chat is community run. There are no representatives from Pine64 company here.
Oct 31 13:07:21 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> Well, technically there are and we can also forward stuff to the right people üòõ
Oct 31 13:08:57 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> But mail issues is usually just the long response time and/or mishaps
Oct 31 13:10:09 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <peac> basically they asked me to confirm an order on the 25th which i answered within 15 minutes and I just received the same email stating "2nd notice" in scary red
Oct 31 13:15:13 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <Funeral> We can try to ask @GAMELASTER to look into it as friendly as possible :>>
Oct 31 13:20:13 <P64ProtocolBot>	[D] <gamiee> hi @peac I will contact you in DM

Oct 31 14:44:29 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <kunrooted> I think I'll get Pinecil for now haha
Oct 31 14:51:19 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <kunrooted> oh Yeah, that's right
Oct 31 14:51:36 <P64ProtocolBot>	[T] <kunrooted> I just wanted to learn hardware hacking to be honest and Pinecil seems as the most reasonable choice
